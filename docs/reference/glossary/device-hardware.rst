    AMD device architecture
        AMD device architecture is based on unified, programmable compute
        engines known as :term:`compute units (CUs) <Compute units>`. See
        :ref:`hip:hardware_implementation` for details.

    Compute units
        Compute units (CUs) are the fundamental programmable execution engines
        in AMD GPUs capable of running complex programs. See
        :ref:`hip:compute_unit` for details.

    ALU
        Arithmetic logic units (ALUs) are the primary arithmetic engines that
        execute mathematical and logical operations within
        :term:`compute units <Compute units>`. See :ref:`hip:valu` for details.

    SALU
        Scalar :term:`ALUs <ALU>` (SALUs) operate on a single value per
        :term:`wavefront <Wavefront>` and manage all control flow.

    VALU
        Vector :term:`ALUs <ALU>` (VALUs) perform an arithmetic or logical
        operation on data for each :term:`work-item <Work-item (Thread)>` in a
        :term:`wavefront <Wavefront>`, enabling data-parallel execution.

    Special function unit
        Special function units (SFUs) accelerate transcendental and reciprocal
        mathematical functions such as ``exp``, ``log``, ``sin``, and ``cos``.
        See :ref:`hip:sfu` for details.

    Load/store unit
        Load/store units (LSUs) handle data transfer between
        :term:`compute units <Compute units>` and the GPU's memory subsystems,
        managing thousands of concurrent memory operations. See :ref:`hip:lsu`
        for details.

    Work-group (Block)
        A work-group (also called a block) is a collection of
        :term:`wavefronts <Wavefront (Warp)>` scheduled together on a single
        :term:`compute unit <Compute units>` that can coordinate through
        :term:`Local data share <Local data share>` memory. See
        :ref:`hip:inherent_thread_hierarchy_block` for work-group details.

    Work-item (Thread)
        A work-item (also called a thread) is the smallest unit of execution on
        an AMD GPU and represents a single element of work. See
        :ref:`hip:work-item` for thread hierarchy details.

    Wavefront (Warp)
        A wavefront (also called a warp) is a group of
        :term:`work-items <Work-item (Thread)>` that execute in parallel on a
        single :term:`compute unit <Compute units>`, sharing one
        instruction stream. See :ref:`hip:wavefront` for execution details.

    Wavefront scheduler
        The wavefront scheduler in each :term:`compute unit <Compute units>`
        decides which :term:`wavefront <wavefront>` to execute each clock cycle,
        enabling rapid context switching for latency hiding. See
        :ref:`hip:wave-scheduling` for details.

    Wavefront size
        The wavefront size is the number of
        :term:`work-items <Work-item (Thread)>` that execute together in a
        single :term:`wavefront <Wavefront (Warp)>`. For AMD Instinct™ GPUs, the
        wavefront size is 64 threads, while AMD Radeon™ GPUs have a wavefront
        size of 32 threads. See :ref:`hip:wavefront` for details.

    SIMD core
        SIMD cores are execution lanes that perform scalar and vector arithmetic
        operations inside each :term:`compute unit <Compute unit>`. See
        :ref:`hip:cdna_architecture` and :ref:`hip:rdna_architecture` for
        details.

    Matrix cores (MFMA units)
        Matrix cores (MFMA units) are specialized execution units that perform
        large-scale matrix operations in a single instruction, delivering high
        throughput for AI and HPC workloads. See :ref:`hip:mfma_units` for
        details.

    Data movement engine
        Data movement engines (DMEs) are specialized hardware units in AMD
        Instinct MI300 and MI350 series GPUs that accelerate multi-dimensional
        tensor data copies between global memory and on-chip memory. See
        :ref:`hip:dme` for details.

    GFX IP
        GFX IP (Graphics IP) versions are identifiers that specify which
        instruction formats, memory models, and compute features are supported
        by each AMD GPU generation. See :ref:`hip:gfx_ip` for versioning
        information.

    GFX IP major version
        The :term:`GFX IP <GFX IP>` major version represents the GPU's core
        instruction set and architecture. For example, a GFX IP `11` major
        version corresponds to the RDNA™ 3 architecture, influencing driver
        support and available compute features. See :ref:`hip:gfx_ip` for
        versioning information.

    GFX IP minor version
        The :term:`GFX IP <GFX IP>` minor version represents specific variations
        within a :term:`GFX IP <GFX IP>` major version and affects feature sets,
        optimizations, and driver behavior. Different GPU models within the same
        major version can have unique capabilities, impacting performance and
        supported instructions. See :ref:`hip:gfx_ip` for versioning
        information.

    Compute unit versioning
        :term:`Compute units <Compute units>` are versioned with
        :term:`GFX IP <GFX IP>` identifiers that define their microarchitectural
        features and instruction set compatibility. See :ref:`hip:gfx_ip` for
        details.

    Register file
