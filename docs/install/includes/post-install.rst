After installing the ROCm Core SDK |ROCM_VERSION| -- see :ref:`rocm-install` --
complete these post-installation steps to complete your system configuration
and validate the installation.

      :heading: Configure your environment
      :heading-level: 3

      Configure environment variables so that ROCm libraries and tools are
      available either to all users on the system or only to your user account.

      .. _rocm-post-install-system-wide:

      .. tab-set::

         .. tab-item:: System-wide setup

            Create a profile script so that all users inherit the ROCm
            environment variables when they start a shell session. Make sure
            you're in the ``therock-tarball`` directory before proceeding.

            .. code-block:: bash

               # Configure ROCm PATH. Make sure you're in the therock-tarball directory before proceeding.
               ROCM_INSTALL_PATH=$(pwd)/install
               sudo tee /etc/profile.d/set-rocm-env.sh << EOF
               export ROCM_PATH=$ROCM_INSTALL_PATH
               export PATH=\$PATH:\$ROCM_PATH/bin
               export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$ROCM_PATH/lib
               EOF
               sudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/set-rocm-env.sh
               source /etc/profile.d/set-rocm-env.sh

         .. tab-item:: User setup

            Configure the ROCm environment for your user by updating your shell
            configuration file.

            1. Add the following to your shell configuration file
               (``~/.bashrc``, ``~/.profile``). Make sure you're in the
               ``therock-tarball`` directory before proceeding.

               .. code-block:: bash

                  # Configure ROCm PATH. Make sure you're in the therock-tarball directory before proceeding.
                  export ROCM_PATH=$PWD/install
                  export PATH=$PATH:$ROCM_PATH/bin
                  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ROCM_PATH/lib

            2. After modifying your shell configuration, apply the change to
               your current session by sourcing your updated shell
               configuration file.

               .. tab-set::

                  .. tab-item:: .bashrc

                     .. code-block:: bash

                        source ~/.bashrc

                  .. tab-item:: .profile

                     .. code-block:: bash

                        source ~/.profile

   .. selected:: os=windows
      :heading: Configure your environment
      :heading-level: 3

      Configure environment variables so that ROCm libraries and tools are
      available on your Windows system.

      1. Set the following environment variables using the command
         prompt as an administrator:

         .. code-block:: bat

            setx HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH “C:\TheRock\build\lib\llvm\amdgcn\bitcode” /M
            setx HIP_PATH “C:\TheRock\build” /M
            setx HIP_PLATFORM “amd” /M
            setx LLVM_PATH “C:\TheRock\build\lib\llvm” /M

      2. Add the following paths into PATH environment variable using your system settings GUI.

         - ``C:\TheRock\build\bin``

         - ``C:\TheRock\build\lib\llvm\bin``

      3. Open a new command prompt window for the environment variables to take effect. Run ``set``
         to see the list of active variables.

         .. code-block:: bat

            set

   Use the following ROCm tools to verify that the ROCm stack is correctly
   installed and that your AMD GPU is visible to the system.

   1. Use ``rocminfo`` to list detected AMD GPUs and confirm that the ROCm
      runtimes and drivers are correctly installed and loaded.

      .. code-block:: bash
