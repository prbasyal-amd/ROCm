*******************************************************************************
JAX compatibility
*******************************************************************************

JAX provides a NumPy-like API, which combines automatic differentiation and the
Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA) compiler to achieve high-performance machine
learning at scale.

JAX uses composable transformations of Python and NumPy through just-in-time
(JIT) compilation, automatic vectorization, and parallelization. To learn about
JAX, including profiling and optimizations, see the official `JAX documentation
<https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html>`_.

ROCm support for JAX is upstreamed, and users can build the official source code
with ROCm support:

- ROCm JAX release:

  - Offers AMD-validated and community :ref:`Docker images <jax-docker-compat>`
    with ROCm and JAX preinstalled.

  - ROCm JAX repository: `ROCm/rocm-jax <https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-jax>`_

  - See the :doc:`ROCm JAX installation guide <rocm-install-on-linux:install/3rd-party/jax-install>`
    to get started.

- Official JAX release:

  - Official JAX repository: `jax-ml/jax <https://github.com/jax-ml/jax>`_

  - See the `AMD GPU (Linux) installation section
    <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#amd-gpu-linux>`_ in
    the JAX documentation.

.. note::

   AMD releases official `ROCm JAX Docker images <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/jax>`_
   quarterly alongside new ROCm releases. These images undergo full AMD testing.
   `Community ROCm JAX Docker images <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/jax-community>`_
   follow upstream JAX releases and use the latest available ROCm version.

Use cases and recommendations
================================================================================

* The `nanoGPT in JAX <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/nanoGPT-JAX/README.html>`_
  blog explores the implementation and training of a Generative Pre-trained
  Transformer (GPT) model in JAX, inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s JAX-based
  nanoGPT. Comparing how essential GPT components—such as self-attention
  mechanisms and optimizers—are realized in JAX and JAX, also highlights
  JAX’s unique features.

* The `Optimize GPT Training: Enabling Mixed Precision Training in JAX using
  ROCm on AMD GPUs <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/jax-mixed-precision/README.html>`_
  blog post provides a comprehensive guide on enhancing the training efficiency
  of GPT models by implementing mixed precision techniques in JAX, specifically
  tailored for AMD GPUs utilizing the ROCm platform.

* The `Supercharging JAX with Triton Kernels on AMD GPUs <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/jax-triton/README.html>`_
  blog demonstrates how to develop a custom fused dropout-activation kernel for
  matrices using Triton, integrate it with JAX, and benchmark its performance
  using ROCm.

* The `Distributed fine-tuning with JAX on AMD GPUs <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/distributed-sft-jax/README.html>`_
  outlines the process of fine-tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations
  from Transformers (BERT)-based large language model (LLM) using JAX for a text
  classification task. The blog post discuss techniques for parallelizing the
  fine-tuning across multiple AMD GPUs and assess the model's performance on a
  holdout dataset. During the fine-tuning, a BERT-base-cased transformer model
  and the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark dataset was
  used on a multi-GPU setup.

* The `MI300X workload optimization guide <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/how-to/tuning-guides/mi300x/workload.html>`_
  provides detailed guidance on optimizing workloads for the AMD Instinct MI300X
  accelerator using ROCm. The page is aimed at helping users achieve optimal
  performance for deep learning and other high-performance computing tasks on
  the MI300X GPU.

.. _jax_comp_known_issues:

Known issues and notes for ROCm 7.0
===============================================================================

- ``nn.dot_product_attention``: Certain configurations of ``jax.nn.dot_product_attention``
  may cause segmentation faults, though the majority of use cases work correctly.

- SVD with dynamic shapes: SVD on inputs with dynamic/symbolic shapes might result in an error.
  SVD with static shapes is unaffected.

- QR decomposition with symbolic shapes: QR decomposition operations may fail when using
  symbolic/dynamic shapes in shape polymorphic contexts.

- Pallas kernels: Specific advanced Pallas kernels may exhibit variations in
  numerical output or resource usage. These are actively reviewed as part of
  Pallas's experimental development.
