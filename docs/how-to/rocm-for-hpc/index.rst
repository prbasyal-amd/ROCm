Using ROCm for HPC
******************

The ROCm open-source software stack is optimized to extract high-performance
computing (HPC) workload performance from AMD Instinct™ accelerators
while maintaining compatibility with industry software frameworks.

ROCm enhances support and access for developers by providing streamlined and
improved tools that significantly increase productivity. Being open-source, ROCm
fosters innovation, differentiation, and collaboration within the developer
community, making it a powerful and accessible solution for leveraging the full
potential of AMD accelerators' capabilities in diverse computational
applications.

* For more information, see :doc:`What is ROCm? <../../what-is-rocm>`.

* For guidance on installing ROCm, see :doc:`rocm-install-on-linux:index`. See
  the :doc:`../../compatibility/compatibility-matrix` for details on hardware
  and operating system support.

Some of the most popular HPC frameworks are part of the ROCm platform, including
those to help parallelize operations across multiple accelerators and servers,
handle memory hierarchies, and solve linear systems.
