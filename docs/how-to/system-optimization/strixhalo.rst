AMD Strix Halo system optimization
==========================================

This document provides guidance for optimizing systems powered by AMD Ryzen AI
MAX and MAX+ processors (codenamed Strix Halo). These APUs combine
high-performance CPU cores with integrated RDNA 3.5 graphics and support up to
128GB of unified LPDDR5X-8000 memory, making them particularly well-suited for:

* LLM development and inference systems
* High-performance workstations
* Virtualization hosts running multiple VMs
* GPU compute and parallel processing
* Gaming systems
* Home servers and AI development platforms

The main purpose of this document is to help users utilize Strix Halo APUs to
their full potential through proper system configuration.

Memory settings
===============

On Strix Halo GPUs (gfx1151) memory access is handled through GPU Virtual Memory
(GPUVM), which provides per-process GPU virtual address spaces (VMIDs) rather
than a separate, discrete VRAM pool.

As a result, memory on Strix Halo is **mapped**, not physically partitioned.
The terms Graphics Address Remapping Table (GART) and GTT (Graphics Translation
Table) describe limits on how much system memory can be mapped into GPU address
spaces and who can use it, rather than distinct types of physical memory.

* **GART**

  Defines the amount of platform address space (system RAM or Memory-Mapped I/O)
  that can be mapped into the GPU virtual address space used by the kernel driver.
  On systems with physically shared CPU and GPU memory, such as Strix Halo, this
  mapped system memory effectively serves as VRAM for the GPU. GART is typically
  kept relatively small to limit GPU page-table size and is mainly used for
  driver-internal operations.

* **GTT**

  Defines the amount of system RAM that can be mapped into GPU virtual address
  spaces for user processes. This is the memory pool used by applications such
  as PyTorch and other AI/compute workloads. GTT allocations are dynamic and are
  not permanently reserved, allowing the operating system to reclaim memory when
  it is not actively used by the GPU. By default, the GTT limit is set to
  approximately 50% of total system RAM.

.. note::

  On systems with physically shared CPU and GPU memory such as Strix Halo,
  several terms are often used interchangeably in firmware menus, documentations
  and community discussions:

  * VRAM
  * Carve-out
  * GART
  * Dedicated GPU memory
  * Firmware-reserved GPU memory

  In this document, we will use VRAM from this point onward.

If desired, you can adjust how much memory is preferentially available to the
GPU by:

* Increasing the VRAM in BIOS, or

* Reducing the configured GTT size so it is smaller than the reserved amount.

If the GTT size bigger than VRAM at that case the amdgpu driver for VRAM allocation
using GTT (GTT-backed allocations) as you can see in
`torvalds/linux@759e764 <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/759e764f7d587283b4e0b01ff930faca64370e59>`_
commit.

Because memory is physically shared, there is no performance distinction
similar to discrete GPUs where dedicated VRAM is significantly faster than
system memory. Firmware may optionally reserve some memory exclusively for GPU
use, but this provides little benefit for most workloads while permanently
reducing available system memory.

For this reason, AI frameworks typically prefer GTT-backed allocations. GTT
allows large, flexible mappings without permanently reserving memory, resulting
in better overall system utilization on unified memory systems.

Configuring shared memory limits on linux
-----------------------------------------

The maximum amount of shared GPU-accessible memory can be increased by changing
the kernel **Translation Table Manager (TTM)** page limit. This setting controls
how many system memory pages may be mapped for GPU use and is exposed at:

::

   /sys/module/ttm/parameters/pages_limit

The value is expressed in **pages**, not bytes or gigabytes (GB).

.. note::

   AMD recommends keeping the dedicated VRAM reservation in BIOS small
   (for example 0.5 GB) and increasing the shared (TTM/GTT) limit instead.

A helper utility is available to simplify configuration.

1. Install ``pipx``:

   ::

      sudo apt install pipx
      pipx ensurepath

2. Install the AMD debug tools:

   ::

      pipx install amd-debug-tools

3. Query the current shared memory configuration:

   ::

      amd-ttm

4. Set the usable shared memory (in GB):

   ::

      amd-ttm --set <NUM>

5. Reboot for changes to take effect.

.. note::

  The amd-ttm convert the pages to GB to help the users.

**Example with output**

Check the current settings:

::

   amd-ttm
   💻 Current TTM pages limit: 16469033 pages (62.82 GB)
   💻 Total system memory: 125.65 GB

Change the usable shared memory:

::

   ❯ amd-ttm --set 100
   🐧 Successfully set TTM pages limit to 26214400 pages (100.00 GB)
   🐧 Configuration written to /etc/modprobe.d/ttm.conf
   ○ NOTE: You need to reboot for changes to take effect.
   Would you like to reboot the system now? (y/n): y

Revert to kernel defaults:

::

   ❯ amd-ttm --clear
  🐧 Configuration /etc/modprobe.d/ttm.conf removed
   Would you like to reboot the system now? (y/n): y

Operating system support
========================

The ROCm compatibility tables can be found at the following links:

- `System requirements (Linux) <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html>`_
- `System requirements (Windows) <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html>`_

However, for Strix Halo there are additional kernel version requirements,
which are described in the following section.

Required kernel version
-----------------------

Support for Strix Halo requires specific fixes in the Linux kernel that
update internal limits in the AMD KFD driver to ensure correct queue
creation and memory availability checks. Without these updates, GPU
compute workloads may fail to initialize or behave unpredictably. The
necessary Linux kernel patches have been merged upstream and are
included in Linux kernel 6.18.4 and newer releases.

The following commits are required for Strix Halo support:

- `gregkh/linux@7f26af7 <https://github.com/gregkh/linux/commit/7f26af7bf9b76c2c2a1a761aab5803e52be21eea>`_
- `gregkh/linux@7445db6 <https://github.com/gregkh/linux/commit/7445db6a7d5a0242d8214582b480600b266cba9e>`_

The table below reflects compatibility for **AMD-released pre-built ROCm
binaries only**. Distributions that ship **native ROCm packaging** may
provide different support levels.
