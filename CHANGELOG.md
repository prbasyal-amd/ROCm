for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (25.3.0)

#### Added

- Added enumeration mapping `amdsmi_get_gpu_enumeration_info()` to Python and C APIs. The mapping is also enabled in the CLI interface via `amd-smi list -e`.

- Added dynamic virtualization mode detection.
  - Added new C and Python API `amdsmi_get_gpu_virtualization_mode_info`.
  - Added new C and Python enum `amdsmi_virtualization_mode_t`.

- Added TVIOL_ACTIVE to `amd-smi monitor`.

- Added support for GPU metrics 1.7 to `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_info()`.

- Added new API `amdsmi_get_gpu_xgmi_link_status()` and CLI `amd-smi xgmi --link-status`.

- Added fclk and socclk info to `amd-smi metric -c/--clock`.

- Added new command `amd-smi set -c/--clock-level`.

- Added new command `amd-smi static -C/--clock`.

#### Changed

- Updated AMD SMI library version number format to reflect changes in backward compatibility and offer more semantic versioning.
  - Removed year from AMD SMI library version number.
  - Version format changed from 25.3.0.0 (Year.Major.Minor.Patch) to 25.3.0 (Major.Minor.Patch).
  - Removed year in all version references.

- Added new Python dependencies: `python3-setuptools` and `python3-wheel`.

- Removed initialization requirements for `amdsmi_get_lib_version()` and added `amdsmi_get_rocm_version()` to the Python API & CLI.

- Added an additional argument `sensor_ind` to `amdsmi_get_power_info()`.
  - This change breaks previous C API calls and will require a change.
  - Python API now accepts `sensor_ind` as an optional argument. This does not impact previous usage.

- Deprecated enum `AMDSMI_NORMAL_STRING_LENGTH` in favor of `AMDSMI_MAX_STRING_LENGTH`.

- Changed to use thread local mutex by default.
  - Most `sysfs` reads do not require cross-process level mutex and writes to `sysfs` should be protected by the kernel already.
  - Users can still switch to the old behavior by setting the environment variable `AMDSMI_MUTEX_CROSS_PROCESS=1`.

- Changed `amdsmi_vram_vendor_type_t` enum names impacting the `amdsmi_vram_info_t` structure. This change also impacts the usage of the `vram_vendor` output of `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()`.

- Changed the `amdsmi_nps_caps_t` struct impacting `amdsmi_memory_partition_config_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_t`, `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_config_t`.
  Affected functions are:

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition_config()`

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`

  - `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile_config()`

- Corrected CLI CPU argument name. `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemtry-rails` is now `--cpu-pwr-svi-telemetry-rails`.

- Added amdgpu driver version and amd_hsmp driver version to the `amd-smi version` command.

- All `amd-smi set` and `amd-smi reset` options are now mutually exclusive. You can now only use one `set` option as a time.

- Changed the name of the `power` field to `energy_accumulator` in the Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()`.

- Added violation status output for Graphics Clock Below Host Limit to `amd-smi` CLI: `amdsmi_get_violation_status()`, `amd-smi metric  --throttle`, and `amd-smi monitor --violation`.
  Users can retrieve violation status through either our Python or C++ APIs. Only available for MI300 series+ ASICs.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_violation_status()` structure and CLI `amdsmi_violation_status_t` to include GFX Clk below host limit.

- Updated API `amdsmi_get_gpu_vram_info()` structure and CLI `amd-smi static --vram`.

#### Removed

- Removed `GFX_BUSY_ACC` from `amd-smi metric --usage` as it did not provide helpful output to users.

#### Optimized

- Added additional help information to `amd-smi set --help` command. The subcommands now detail what values are accepted as input.

- Modified `amd-smi` CLI to allow case insensitive arguments if the argument does not begin with a single dash.

- Converted `xgmi` read and write from KBs to dynamically selected readable units.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info` and `amd-smi static --asic` not displaying graphics version correctly for Instinct MI200 series, Instinct MI100 series, and RDNA3-based GPUs.

#### Known issues

- AMD SMI only reports 63 GPU devices when setting CPX on all 8 GPUs. When setting CPX as a partition mode, there is a DRM node limitation of 64.

This is a known limitation of the Linux kernel; not the driver. Other drivers, such as those using PCIe space (for example, `ast`), might occupy the necessary DRM nodes.  You can check the number of DRM nodes using `ls /sys/class/drm`.

Some workaround options are as follows:

  - Remove other devices occupying DRM nodes.

    Recommended steps for removing unnecessary drivers:

    1. Unload amdgpu - `sudo rmmod amdgpu`.

    2. Remove unnecessary driver(s) - ex. `sudo rmmod ast`.

    3. Reload amgpu - `sudo modprobe amdgpu`.

    4. Confirm `amd-smi list` reports all nodes (this can vary per MI ASIC).

  - Update your OS kernel.

  - Build and install your own kernel.

#### Upcoming changes

- The `AMDSMI_LIB_VERSION_YEAR` enum and API fields will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

- The `pasid` field in struct `amdsmi_process_info_t` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **HIP** (6.4.0)

#### Added

* New HIP APIs

    - `hipDeviceGetTexture1DLinearMaxWidth`  returns the maximum width of elements in a 1D linear texture, which can be allocated on the specified device.
    - `hipStreamBatchMemOp`  enqueues an array of batch memory operations in the stream, for stream synchronization.
    - `hipGraphAddBatchMemOpNode`  creates a batch memory operation node and adds it to a graph.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeGetParams`  returns the pointer of parameters from the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets parameters for the batch memory operation node.
    - `hipGraphExecBatchMemOpNodeSetParams`  sets the parameters for a batch memory operation node in the given executable graph.
    - `hipLinkAddData` adds SPIR-V code object data to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkAddFile` adds SPIR-V code object file to linker instance with options.
    - `hipLinkCreate`  creates linker instance at runtime with options.
    - `hipLinkComplete` completes linking of program and output linker binary to use with hipModuleLoadData.
    - `hipLinkDestroy`  deletes linker instance.

#### Changed

* `roc-obj` tools is deprecated and will be removed in an upcoming release.

    - Perl package installation is not required, and users will need to install this themselves if they want to.
    - Support for ROCm Object tooling has moved into `llvm-objdump` provided by package `rocm-llvm`.

* SDMA retainer logic is removed for engine selection in operation of runtime buffer copy.

#### Optimized

* `hipGraphLaunch` parallelism is improved for complex data-parallel graphs.
* Make the round-robin queue selection in command scheduling. For multi-streams execution, HSA queue from null stream lock is freed and won't occupy the queue ID after the kernel in the stream is finished.
* The HIP runtime doesn't free bitcode object before code generation. It adds a cache, which allows compiled code objects to be reused instead of recompiling. This improves performance on multi-GPU systems.
* Runtime now uses unified copy approach:

    - Unpinned `H2D` copies are no longer blocking until the size of 1 MB.
    - Kernel copy path is enabled for unpinned `H2D`/`D2H` methods.
    - The default environment variable `GPU_FORCE_BLIT_COPY_SIZE` is set to `16`, which limits the kernel copy to sizes less than 16 KB, while copies larger than that would be handled by `SDMA` engine.
    - Blit code is refactored, and ASAN instrumentation is cleaned up.

#### Resolved issues

* Out-of-memory error on Microsoft Windows. When the user calls `hipMalloc` for device memory allocation while specifying a size larger than the available device memory, the HIP runtime fixes the error in the API implementation, allocating the available device memory plus system memory (shared virtual memory).
* Error of dependency on `libgcc-s1` during rocm-dev install on Debian Buster. HIP runtime now uses `libgcc1` for this distros.
* Stack corruption during kernel execution. HIP runtime now adds a maximum stack size limit based on the GPU device feature. 

#### Upcoming changes

The following lists the backward incompatible changes planned for upcoming major ROCm releases.

* Signature changes in APIs to correspond with NVIDIA CUDA APIs,

    - `hiprtcCreateProgram`
    - `hiprtcCompileProgram`
    - `hipCtxGetApiVersion`

* Behavior of `hipPointerGetAttributes` is changed to match corresponding CUDA API in version 11 and later releases.
* Return error/value code updates in the following hip APIs to match the corresponding CUDA APIs,

    - `hipModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipExtModuleLaunchKernel`
    - `hipModuleLaunchCooperativeKernel`
    - `hipGetTextureAlignmentOffset`
    - `hipTexObjectCreate`
    - `hipBindTexture2D`
    - `hipBindTextureToArray`
    - `hipModuleLoad`
    - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
    - `hipExtLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`

* HIPRTC implementation, the compilation of `hiprtc` now uses  namespace ` __hip_internal`, instead of the standard headers `std`.
* Stream capture mode updates in the following HIP APIs. Streams can only be captured in relax mode, to match the behavior of the corresponding CUDA APIs,

   - `hipMallocManaged`
   - `hipMemAdvise`
   - `hipLaunchCooperativeKernelMultiDevice`
   - `hipDeviceSetCacheConfig`
   - `hipDeviceSetSharedMemConfig`
   - `hipMemPoolCreate`
   - `hipMemPoolDestory`
   - `hipDeviceSetMemPool`
   - `hipEventQuery`

* The implementation of `hipStreamAddCallback` is updated, to match the behavior of CUDA.
* Removal of `hiprtc` symbols from hip library.

    - `hiprtc` will be a independent library, and all symbols supported in HIP library are removed.
    - Any application using `hiprtc` APIs should link explicitly with `hiprtc` library.
    - This change makes the use of `hiprtc` library on Linux the same as on Windows, and matches the behavior of CUDA `nvrtc`.

* Removal of deprecated struct `HIP_MEMSET_NODE_PARAMS`, Developers can use definition `hipMemsetParams` instead.

### **hipBLAS** (2.4.0)

#### Changed

* Updated the build dependencies.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the Windows reference library interface for rocSOLVER functions for hipBLAS clients.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.12.0)

* Reduce the library size.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed multi-threads bug.
* Fixed multi-streams bug.

### **hipCUB** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added `ForEach`, `ForEachN`, `ForEachCopy`, `ForEachCopyN` and `Bulk` functions to have parity with CUB.
* Added the `hipcub::CubVector` type for CUB parity.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Unit tests can be run with `[--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>;`.
* Added `DeviceSelect::FlaggedIf` and its inplace overload.
* Added CUB macros missing from hipCUB: `HIPCUB_MAX`, `HIPCUB_MIN`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_FLOOR`, `HIPCUB_QUOTIENT_CEILING`, `HIPCUB_ROUND_UP_NEAREST` and `HIPCUB_ROUND_DOWN_NEAREST`.
* Added `hipcub::AliasTemporaries` function for CUB parity.

#### Changed

* Removed usage of `std::unary_function` and `std::binary_function` in `test_hipcub_device_adjacent_difference.cpp`.
* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete with faster run time and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.5.0. If it is not found, it will be downloaded from the NVIDIA CCCL repository.
* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.

#### Known issues

* When building on Microsoft Windows using HIP SDK for ROCm 6.4, ``hipMalloc`` returns ``hipSuccess`` even when the size passed to it is too large and the allocation fails. Because of this, limits have been set for the maximum test case sizes for some unit tests such as HipcubDeviceRadixSort&#39;s SortKeysLargeSizes .

### **hipFFT** (1.0.18)

#### Added

* Implemented the `hipfftMpAttachComm`, `hipfftXtSetDistribution`, and `hipfftXtSetSubformatDefault` APIs to allow
  computing FFTs that are distributed between multiple MPI (Message Passing Interface) processes.  These APIs can be enabled
  with the `HIPFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option, which defaults to `OFF`. The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

  The backend FFT library called by hipFFT must support MPI for these APIs to work.

#### Changed

* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU
  architectures.
* Use the `find_package` CUDA toolkit instead of CUDA in CMake for modern CMake compatibility.
* The `AMDGPU_TARGETS` build variable should be replaced with `GPU_TARGETS`. `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is deprecated.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the client packages so they depend on hipRAND instead of rocRAND.

### **hipfort** (0.6.0)

#### Upcoming changes

* The hipfc compiler wrapper has been deprecated and will be removed
  in a future release. Users are encouraged to directly invoke their
  Fortran or HIP compilers as appropriate for each source file.

* Support for `fp8` math device/host API. For more information see [#1617](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1617) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

#### Resolved issues
* `MIOpen` support in hipify-perl under the `-miopen` option
* Use `const_cast<const char**>` for the last arguments in the `hiprtcCreateProgram` and `hiprtcCompileProgram` function calls, as in CUDA, they are of the `const char* const*` type
* Support for `fp16` device/host API. For more information see [#1769](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1769) in the HIPIFY Github repository.
* Fixed instructions on building LLVM for HIPIFY on Linux. For more information see [#1800](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/1800) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

#### Known issues

* `hipify-clang` build failure against LLVM 15-18 on `Ubuntu`, `CentOS`, and `Fedora`. For more information see [#833](https://github.com/ROCm/HIPIFY/issues/833) in the HIPIFY Github repository.

### **hipRAND** (2.12.0)

#### Changed

* When building hipRAND on Windows, use `HIP_PATH` (instead of the former `HIP_DIR`) to specify the path to the HIP SDK installation.
* When building with the `rmake.py` script, `HIP_PATH` will default to `C:\hip` if it is not set.
  
#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue causing hipRAND build failures on Windows when the HIP SDK was installed in a location with a path that contains spaces.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.4.0)

#### Added

* The `csrlsvqr` compatibility-only functions `hipsolverSpScsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpDcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpCcsrlsvqr`, `hipsolverSpZcsrlsvqr`

### **hipSPARSE** (3.2.0)

#### Optimized

* Optimized the hyper-parameter selection algorithm for permutation.

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* hipTensor will enhance performance and usability while unifying the API design across all operations (elementwise, reductions, and tensor contractions), enabling consistent multi-stage execution and plan reuse. As part of this change, the API functions `hiptensorInitTensorDescriptor`, `hiptensorContractionDescriptor_t` , `hiptensorInitContractionDescriptor`, `hiptensorInitContractionFind`, `hiptensorContractionGetWorkspaceSize`, `hiptensorInitContractionPlan`, `hiptensorContraction`, `hiptensorElementwiseBinary`, `hiptensorElementwiseTrinary`, `hiptensorPermutation`, and `hiptensorReduction` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

### **llvm-project** (19.0.0)

#### Added

* Support for `amdgpu_max_num_work_groups` in the compiler. This attribute
  can be set by end users or library developers. It provides an upper limit
  for workgroups as described in [AMD GPU Attributes](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#amdgpu-max-num-work-groups).
  When set, the AMDGPU target backend might produce better machine code.

#### Added

* The new bitstream reader feature has been added. The bitstream reader contains built-in stream file parsers, including an elementary stream file parser and an IVF container file parser. The reader can parse AVC, HEVC, and AV1 elementary stream files, and AV1 IVF container files. Additional supported formats will be added.
* VP9 support has been added.
* More CTests have been added: VP9 test and tests on video decode raw sample.
* Two new samples, videodecoderaw and videodecodepicfiles, have been added. videodecoderaw uses the bitstream reader instead of the FFMPEG demuxer to get picture data, and videodecodepicfiles shows how to decode an elementary video stream stored in multiple files, with each file containing bitstream data of a coded picture.

#### Changed

* AMD Clang++ is now the default CXX compiler.
* Moved MD5 code out of the RocVideoDecode utility.

#### Removed

* FFMPEG executable requirement for the package.

### **rocFFT** (1.0.32)

#### Changed

* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ on the relevant GPU
  architectures and adds address-sanitizer support to runtime-compiled
  kernels.
* The `AMDGPU_TARGETS` build variable should be replaced with `GPU_TARGETS`. `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is deprecated.

#### Removed

* Ahead-of-time compiled kernels for the gfx906, gfx940, and gfx941 architectures. These architectures still work the same way, but their kernels are now compiled at runtime.
* Consumer GPU architectures from the precompiled kernel cache that ships with
  rocFFT. rocFFT continues to ship with a cache of precompiled RTC kernels for data center
  and workstation architectures. As before, user-level caches can be enabled by setting the
  environment variable `ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH` to a writeable file location.

#### Optimized

* Improved MPI transform performance by using all-to-all communication for global transpose operations.  
  Point-to-point communications are still used when all-to-all is unavailable.
* Improved the performance of unit-strided, complex interleaved, forward, and inverse length (64,64,64) FFTs.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results from 2-kernel 3D FFT plans that used non-default output strides. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/507).
* Plan descriptions can now be reused with different strides for different plans. For more information, see the [rocFFT GitHub issue](https://github.com/ROCm/rocFFT/issues/504).
* Fixed client packages to depend on hipRAND instead of rocRAND.
* Fixed potential integer overflows during large MPI transforms.

### **rocPRIM** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* The parallel `find_first_of` device function with autotuned configurations has been added. This function is similar to `std::find_first_of`. It searches for the first occurrence of any of the provided elements.
* Tuned configurations for segmented radix sort for gfx942 have been added to improve performance on the gfx942 architecture.
* The parallel device-level function, `rocprim::adjacent_find`, which is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::adjacent_find` algorithm, has been added.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to device adjacent find (`rocprim::adjacent_find`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* `rocprim::numeric_limits` has been added. This is an extension of `std::numeric_limits` that supports 128-bit integers.
* `rocprim::int128_t` and `rocprim::uint128_t` have been added. 
* The parallel `search` and `find_end` device functions have been added. These are similar to `std::search` and `std::find_end`. These functions search for the first and last occurrence of the sequence, respectively.
* A parallel device-level function, `rocprim::search_n`, has been added. `rocprim::search_n` is similar to the C++ Standard Library `std::search_n` algorithm.
* New constructors, a `base` function, and a `constexpr` specifier have been added to all functions in `rocprim::reverse_iterator` to improve parity with the C++17 `std::reverse_iterator`.
* hipGraph support has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`).
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for non-trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode_non_trivial_runs`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* Configuration autotuning has been added to the device run-length-encode for trivial runs (`rocprim::run_length_encode`) for improved performance on selected architectures.
* The `--emulation` option has been added to `rtest.py`. Unit tests can be run with `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=<test_name>`.
* Extended and regression tests have been added to `rtest.py`. Extended tests are tests that don't fit the criteria of smoke or regression tests, and take longer than smoke or regression tests to run. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run extended tests, and `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run regression tests.
* Added a new type traits interface to enable users to provide additional type trait information to rocPRIM, facilitating better compatibility with custom types.

#### Changed

* Changed the subset of tests that are run for smoke tests such that the smoke test will complete faster and never exceed 2 GB of VRAM usage. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `rtest.py` options have changed. `rtest.py` is now run with at least either `--test|-t` or `--emulation|-e`, but not both options.
* Changed the internal algorithm of block radix sort to use a rank match. This improves the performance of various radix sort-related algorithms.
* Disabled padding in various cases where higher occupancy resulted in better performance despite more bank conflicts.
* The C++ version has changed from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* You can use CMake HIP language support with CMake 3.18 and later. To use HIP language support, run `cmake` with `-DUSE_HIPCXX=ON` instead of setting the `CXX` variable to the path to a HIP-aware compiler.

#### Removed

* HIP-CPU support

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where `rmake.py` generated incorrect cmake commands in a Linux environment.
* Fixed an issue where `rocprim::partial_sort_copy` would yield a compile error if the input iterator was a const.
* Fixed incorrect 128-bit signed and unsigned integer type traits.
* Fixed a compilation issue when `rocprim::radix_key_codec<...>` is specialized with a 128-bit integer.
* Fixed the warp-level reduction `rocprim::warp_reduce.reduce` DPP implementation to avoid undefined intermediate values during the reduction.
* Fixed an issue that caused a segmentation fault when `hipStreamLegacy` was passed to certain API functions.

#### Upcoming changes

* Using the initialization constructor of `rocprim::reverse_iterator` will throw a deprecation warning. It will be marked as explicit in the next major release.

#### Resolved issues

* Ubuntu 24.04 compile failure with FFmpeg version 5.X and above has been fixed.

### **rocRAND** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. They take much longer to run relative to smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* The `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`.

#### Changed

* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Removed the TBB dependency for multi-core processing of host-side generation.

### **ROCr Debug Agent** (2.0.4)

#### Added

* Functionality to print the associated kernel name for each wave.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.15.0)

#### Added

* Support for asynchronous scratch reclaim on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Asynchronous scratch reclaim allows scratch memory that was assigned to Command Processor(cp) queues to be reclaimed back in case the application runs out of device memory or if the `hsa_amd_agent_set_async_scratch_limit` API is called with the threshold parameter as 0.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.28.0)

#### Added

* Application of a sequence of plane rotations to a given matrix for LASR
* Algorithm selection mechanism for hybrid computation
* Hybrid computation support for existing routines:
    - BDSQR
    - GESVD

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of SYEVJ.
* Improved the performance of GEQRF.

### **rocSPARSE** (3.4.0)

#### Added

* Added support for `rocsparse_matrix_type_triangular` in `rocsparse_spsv`.
* Added test filters `smoke`, `regression`, and `extended` for emulation tests.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines for iterative ILU.
* Added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines for iterative triangular solve.
* Added `GPU_TARGETS` to replace the now deprecated `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files.
* Added BSR format to the SpMM generic routine `rocsparse_spmm`.

#### Changed

* By default, the rocSPARSE shared library is built using the `--offload-compress` compiler option which compresses the fat binary. This significantly reduces the shared library binary size.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of `rocsparse_spmm` when used with row order for `B` and `C` dense matrices and the row split algorithm `rocsparse_spmm_alg_csr_row_split`.
* Improved the adaptive CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix has many empty rows at the beginning or at the end of the matrix. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the adaptive algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_adaptive` is used.
* Improved stream CSR sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm when the sparse matrix size (number of rows) decreases. This improves the routines `rocsparse_spmv` and `rocsparse_spmv_ex` when the stream algorithm `rocsparse_spmv_alg_csr_stream` is used.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria, if enabled. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Compared to `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve`, the routines `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` introduce several free iterations. A free iteration is an iteration that does not compute the evaluation of the stopping criteria. This allows the user to tune the algorithm for performance improvements.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_spgemm`, `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csrgemm`, and `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]bsrgemm` where incorrect results could be produced when rocSPARSE was built with optimization level `O0`. This was caused by a bug in the hash tables that could allow keys to be inserted twice.
* Fixed an issue in the routine `rocsparse_spgemm` when using `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_symbolic` and `rocsparse_spgemm_stage_numeric`, where the routine would crash when `alpha` and `beta` were passed as host pointers and where `beta != 0`.
* Fixed an issue in `rocsparse_bsrilu0`, where the algorithm was running out of bounds of the `bsr_val` array.

#### Upcoming changes

* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritilu0_compute_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve` routines. Users should use the newly added `rocsparse_[s|d|c|z]csritsv_solve_ex` routines going forward.
* Deprecated the use of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in CMake files. Users should use `GPU_TARGETS` going forward.

### **ROCTracer** (4.1.0)

#### Added

* Tool deprecation message for ROCTracer.

### **rocThrust** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Added a section to install Thread Building Block (TBB) inside `cmake/Dependencies.cmake` if TBB is not already available.
* Made TBB an optional dependency with the new `BUILD_HIPSTDPAR_TEST_WITH_TBB` flag. When the flag is `OFF` and TBB is not already on the machine, it will compile without TBB. Otherwise, it will compile with TBB.
* Added extended tests to `rtest.py`. These tests are extra tests that did not fit the criteria of smoke and regression tests. These tests will take much longer than smoke and regression tests. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=extended` to run these tests.
* Added regression tests to `rtest.py`. These tests recreate scenarios that have caused hardware problems in past emulation environments. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=regression` to run these tests.
* Added smoke test options, which run a subset of the unit tests and ensure that less than 2 GB of VRAM will be used. Use `python rtest.py [--emulation|-e|--test|-t]=smoke` to run these tests.
* Added `--emulation` option for `rtest.py`
* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.4.0 and CCCL/thrust 2.5.0.
* Added `find_first_of`, `find_end`, `search`, and `search_n` to HIPSTDPAR.
* Updated HIPSTDPAR's `adjacent_find` to use the rocPRIM implementation.

#### Changed

* Changed the C++ version from 14 to 17. C++14 will be deprecated in the next major release.
* `--test|-t` is no longer a required flag for `rtest.py`. Instead, the user can use either `--emulation|-e` or `--test|-t`, but not both.
* Split HIPSTDPAR's forwarding header into several implementation headers.
* Fixed `copy_if` to work with large data types (512 bytes).

#### Known issues

*  `thrust::inclusive_scan_by_key` might produce incorrect results when it's used with -O2 or -O3 optimization.  This is caused by a recent compiler change and a fix will be made available at a later date.

### **rocWMMA** (1.7.0)

#### Added

* Added interleaved layouts that enhance the performance of GEMM operations.
* Emulation test suites. These suites are lightweight and well suited for execution on emulator platforms.

#### Changed

* Used `GPU_TARGETS` instead of `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in `cmakelists.txt`.
* Binary sizes can be reduced on supported compilers by using the `--offload-compress` compiler flag.

#### Resolved issues

* For a CMake bug workaround, set `CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH` when `BUILD_OFFLOAD_COMPRESS` is unset.

#### Upcoming changes
 
* rocWMMA will augment the fragment API objects with additional meta-properties that improve API expressiveness and configurability of parameters including multiple-wave cooperation. As part of this change, cooperative rocWMMA API functions `load_matrix_coop_sync` and `store_matrix_coop_sync` will be deprecated in a future ROCm release.

## ROCm 6.3.3

See the [ROCm 6.3.3 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.3/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (0.1.2)

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an error that prevented GPU hardware activity from being presented in certain workloads.  

## ROCm 6.3.2

See the [ROCm 6.3.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.2/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **HIP** (6.3.2)

#### Added

* Tracking of Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) handlers:
    - Adds an atomic counter to track the outstanding HSA handlers.
    - Waits on CPU for the callbacks if the number exceeds the defined value.
* Codes to capture Architected Queueing Language (AQL) packets for HIP graph memory copy node between host and device. HIP enqueues AQL packets during graph launch.
* Control to use system pool implementation in runtime commands handling. By default, it is disabled.
* A new path to avoid `WaitAny` calls in `AsyncEventsLoop`. The new path is selected by default.
* Runtime control on decrement counter only if the event is popped. There is a new way to restore dead signals cleanup for the old path.
* A new logic in runtime to track the age of events from the kernel mode driver.

#### Optimized

* HSA callback performance. The HIP runtime creates and submits commands in the queue and interacts with HSA through a callback function. HIP waits for the CPU status from HSA to optimize the handling of events, profiling, commands, and HSA signals for higher performance.
* Runtime optimization which combines all logic of `WaitAny` in a single processing loop and avoids extra memory allocations or reference counting. The runtime won't spin on the CPU if all events are busy.
* Multi-threaded dispatches for performance improvement.
* Command submissions and processing between CPU and GPU by introducing a way to limit the software batch size.
* Switch to `std::shared_mutex` in book/keep logic in streams from multiple threads simultaneously, for performance improvement in specific customer applications.
* `std::shared_mutex` is used in memory object mapping, for performance improvement.

#### Resolved issues

* Race condition in multi-threaded producer/consumer scenario with `hipMallocFromPoolAsync`.
* Segmentation fault with `hipStreamLegacy` while using the API `hipStreamWaitEvent`.
* Usage of `hipStreamLegacy` in HIP event record.
* A soft hang in graph execution process from HIP user object. The fix handles the release of graph execution object properly considering synchronization on the device/stream. The user application now behaves the same with `hipUserObject` on both the AMD ROCm and NVIDIA CUDA platforms.

### **hipfort** (0.5.1)

- New violation status outputs and APIs: `amdsmi_status_t amdsmi_get_violation_status()`, `amd-smi metric  --throttle`, and `amd-smi monitor --violation`. This feature is only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Ability to view XCP (Graphics Compute Partition) activity within `amd-smi metric --usage`. Partition-specific features are only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Added `LC_PERF_OTHER_END_RECOVERY` CLI output to `amd-smi metric --pcie` and updated `amdsmi_get_pcie_info()` to include this value. This feature is only available on MI300+ ASICs

- Ability to retrieve a set of GPUs that are nearest to a given device at a specific link type level
  - Added `amdsmi_get_link_topology_nearest()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.

- More supported utilization count types to `amdsmi_get_utilization_count()`

- `amd-smi set -L/--clk-limit ...` command. This is equivalent to rocm-smi's `--extremum` command which sets sclk's or mclk's soft minimum or soft maximum clock frequency.

- Unittest functionality to test `amdsmi` API calls in Python

- GPU memory overdrive percentage to `amd-smi metric -o`
  - Added `amdsmi_get_gpu_mem_overdrive_level()` function to AMD SMI C and Python Libraries.

- Ability to retrieve connection type and P2P capabilities between two GPUs
  - Added `amdsmi_topo_get_p2p_status()` function to amd-smi C and Python Libraries.
  - Added retrieving P2P link capabilities to CLI `amd-smi topology`.

- New `amdsmi_kfd_info_t` type and added information under `amd-smi list`

- Subsystem device ID to `amd-smi static --asic`. There are no underlying changes to `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info`.

- `Target_Graphics_Version` to `amd-smi static --asic` and `amdsmi_get_gpu_asic_info()`.

#### Changed

- Updated BDF commands to use KFD SYSFS for BDF: `amdsmi_get_gpu_device_bdf()`. This change aligns BDF output with ROCm SMI.

- Moved Python tests directory path install location.
  - `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/pytest/..` to `/opt/<rocm-path>/share/amd_smi/tests/python_unittest/..`
  - Removed PyTest dependency. Python testing now depends on the unittest framework only.

- Changed the `power` parameter in `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` to `energy_accumulator`.
  - Changes propagate forwards into the Python interface as well. Backwards compatibility is maintained.

- Updated Partition APIs and struct information and added `partition_id` to `amd-smi static --partition`.
  - As part of an overhaul to partition information, some partition information will be made available in the `amdsmi_accelerator_partition_profile_t`.
  - This struct will be filled out by a new API, `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()`.
  - Future data from these APIs will eventually be added to `amd-smi partition`.

#### Removed

- `amd-smi reset --compute-partition` and `... --memory-partition` and associated APIs
  - This change is part of the partition redesign. Reset functionality will be reintroduced in a later update.
  - Associated APIs include `amdsmi_reset_gpu_compute_partition()` and `amdsmi_reset_gpu_memory_partition()`

- Usage of `_validate_positive` is removed in parser and replaced with `_positive_int` and `_not_negative_int` as appropriate.
  - This will allow `0` to be a valid input for several options in setting CPUs where appropriate (for example, as a mode or NBIOID).

#### Optimized

- Adjusted ordering of `gpu_metrics` calls to ensure that `pcie_bw` values remain stable in `amd-smi metric` & `amd-smi monitor`.
  - With this change additional padding was added to `PCIE_BW` `amd-smi monitor --pcie`

#### Known issues

- See [AMD SMI manual build issue](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.3.0/about/release-notes.html#amd-smi-manual-build-issue).

#### Resolved issues

- Improved Offline install process and lowered dependency for PyYAML.

- Fixed CPX not showing total number of logical GPUs.

- Fixed incorrect implementation of the Python API `amdsmi_get_gpu_metrics_header_info()`.

- `amdsmitst` `TestGpuMetricsRead` now prints metric in correct units.

#### Upcoming changes

- Python API for `amdsmi_get_energy_count()` will deprecate the `power` field in a future ROCm release and use `energy_accumulator` field instead.

- New memory and compute partition APIs will be added in a future ROCm release.
  - These APIs will be updated to fully populate the CLI and allowing compute (accelerator) partitions to be set by profile ID.
  - One API will be provided, to reset both memory and compute (accelerator).
  - The following APIs will remain:

    ```C
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_set_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      amdsmi_compute_partition_type_t compute_partition);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_compute_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      char *compute_partition, uint32_t len);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_get_gpu_memory_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,

                                      char *memory_partition, uint32_t len);
    amdsmi_status_t
    amdsmi_set_gpu_memory_partition(amdsmi_processor_handle processor_handle,
                                      amdsmi_memory_partition_type_t memory_partition);
    ```

- `amd-smi set --compute-partition "SPX/DPX/CPX..."` will no longer be supported in a future ROCm release.
  - This is due to aligning with Host setups and providing more robust partition information through the APIs outlined above. Furthermore, new APIs which will be available on both BM/Host can set by profile ID.

- Added a preliminary `amd-smi partition` command.
  - The new partition command can display GPU information, including memory and accelerator partition information.
  - The command will be at full functionality once additional partition information from `amdsmi_get_gpu_accelerator_partition_profile()` has been implemented.

  `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`, continue to be hidden behind the
  preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
  unconditionally in the next ROCm release.

### **hipBLAS** (2.3.0)

#### Added

* Level 3 functions have an additional `ILP64` API for both C and Fortran (`_64` name suffix) with `int64_t` function arguments

### **hipCUB** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* Support for large indices in `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::*` has been added, with the exception
  of `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. Although rocPRIM's backend provides support for all reduce
  variants, CUB does not support large indices in `DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`. For this reason,
  large index support is not available for `hipcub::DeviceSegmentedReduce::Arg*`.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* The NVIDIA backend now requires CUB, Thrust, and libcu++ 2.3.2.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Fixed an issue where `config.hpp` was not included in all hipCUB headers, resulting in build errors.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.17)

#### Changed

* The AMD backend is now compiled using amdclang++ instead of hipcc. The NVIDIA CUDA backend still uses hipcc-nvcc.
* CLI11 replaces Boost Program Options as the command line parser for clients.
* Building with the address sanitizer option sets xnack+ for the relevant GPU architectures.

### **hipfort** (0.5.0)

#### Added

* Added ROC-TX to the hipfort interfaces.

#### Changed

#### Changed

* Updated the default value for the `-a` argument from `rmake.py` to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.

#### Known issues

* In ROCm 6.3.0, the hipRAND package version is incorrectly set to `2.11.0`. In ROCm
  6.2.4, the hipRAND package version was `2.11.1`. The hipRAND version number will be corrected in a
  future ROCm release.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing the CMake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.3.0)

#### Added

* Auxiliary functions:
    * `hipsolverSetDeterministicMode`, `hipsolverGetDeterministicMode`
* Compatibility-only functions:
  * `potrf`
    * `hipsolverDnXpotrf_bufferSize`
    * `hipsolverDnXpotrf`
  * `potrs`
    * `hipsolverDnXpotrs`
  * `geqrf`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf_bufferSize`
    * `hipsolverDnXgeqrf`

#### Changed

* Binaries in debug builds no longer have a `-d` suffix.
* Changed rocSPARSE and SuiteSparse to be runtime dependencies by default. The `BUILD_WITH_SPARSE` CMake option can still be used
  to convert them into build-time dependencies (now off by default).
* The `--no-sparse` option for the install script now only affects the hipSOLVER clients and their dependency on hipSPARSE. Use the
  `BUILD_HIPSPARSE_TESTS` CMake option to enable tests for the `hipsolverSp` API (on by default).

#### Upcoming changes

* The Fortran bindings provided in `hipsolver_module.f90` have been deprecated.
  The Fortran bindings provided by the hipfort project are recommended instead.

### **hipSPARSE** (3.1.2)

#### Added

* Added an alpha version of the `hipsparse-bench` executable to facilitate comparing NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE and rocSPARSE backends.

#### Changed

* Changed the default compiler from hipcc to amdclang in the install script and CMake files.
* Improved the user documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the gfortran dependency for the Azure Linux operating system.

#### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is passed as a parameter. This does not match the NVIDIA CUDA cuSPARSE API. This extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now, this extra parameter can be ignored and `nullptr` passed as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.2)

#### Added

* Support for a new data type combination: `INT8` inputs, `BF16` output, and `INT32` Matrix Core accumulation
* Support for row-major memory order (`HIPSPARSE_ORDER_ROW`)

#### Changed

* Changed the default compiler to amdclang++.

#### Upcoming changes

* `hipsparseLtDatatype_t` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of ROCm. `hipDataType` should be used instead.

### **hipTensor** (1.4.0)

  distributed across multiple MPI ranks. These APIs can be enabled with the
  `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` CMake option.  This option defaults to `OFF`.

  When `ROCFFT_MPI_ENABLE` is `ON`:

  * `rocfft_plan_description_set_comm` can be called to provide an
    MPI communicator to a plan description, which can then be passed
    to `rocfft_plan_create`.  Each rank calls

Driver now has the ability to report what the user can set memory partition modes to. User can now see available
memory partition modes upon an invalid argument return from memory partition mode set (`rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set`).

- Support for GPU metrics 1.6 to `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()`. Updated
  `rsmi_dev_gpu_metrics_info_get()` and structure `rsmi_gpu_metrics_t` to include new fields for
  PVIOL / TVIOL, XCP (Graphics Compute Partitions) stats, and `pcie_lc_perf_other_end_recovery`.

- Ability to view raw GPU metrics using `rocm-smi --showmetrics`.

#### Changed

- Added back in C++ tests for `memorypartition_read_write`

- Updated `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_set` to not return until a successful restart of AMD GPU Driver.

- All APIs now have the ability to catch driver reporting invalid arguments.

#### Removals

- Removed `--resetcomputepartition`, and  `--resetmemorypartition` options and associated APIs.
  - This change is part of the partition feature redesign.
  - The related APIs `rsmi_dev_compute_partition_reset()` and `rsmi_dev_memory_partition_reset()`.

#### Resolved issues

```

### **ROCm Systems Profiler** (0.1.0)

#### Changed

* Renamed to ROCm Systems Profiler from Omnitrace.
  * New package name: `rocprofiler-systems`
  * New repository: [https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-systems)
  * Reset the version to `0.1.0`
  * New binary prefix: `rocprof-sys-*`

#### Known issues

- See [ROCm Systems Profiler post-upgrade](#rocm-systems-profiler-post-upgrade).

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.1.0)

#### Added

- Support for hipBLASLT blas library and option to select blas library in `conf` file.

#### Changed

- Babel parameters made runtime configurable.

#### Known issues

- See [ROCm Validation Suite needs specified configuration file](#rocm-validation-suite-needs-specified-configuration-file).

### **rocPRIM** (3.3.0)

#### Added

* The `--test smoke` option has been added to `rtest.py`. When `rtest.py` is called with this option it runs a subset of tests such that the total test time is 5 minutes. Use `python3 ./rtest.py --test smoke` or `python3 ./rtest.py -t smoke` to run the smoke test.
* The `--seed` option has been added to `run_benchmarks.py`. The `--seed` option specifies a seed for the generation of random inputs. When the option is omitted, the default behavior is to use a random seed for each benchmark measurement.
* Added configuration autotuning to device partition (`rocprim::partition`, `rocprim::partition_two_way`, and `rocprim::partition_three_way`), to device select (`rocprim::select`, `rocprim::unique`, and `rocprim::unique_by_key`), and to device reduce by key (`rocprim::reduce_by_key`) to improve performance on selected architectures.
* Added `rocprim::uninitialized_array` to provide uninitialized storage in local memory for user-defined types.
* Added large segment support for `rocprim:segmented_reduce`.
* Added a parallel `nth_element` device function similar to `std::nth_element`. `nth_element` places elements that are smaller than the nth element before the nth element, and elements that are bigger than the nth element after the nth element.
* Added deterministic (bitwise reproducible) algorithm variants `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan`, `rocprim::deterministic_inclusive_scan_by_key`, `rocprim::deterministic_exclusive_scan_by_key`, and `rocprim::deterministic_reduce_by_key`. These provide run-to-run stable results with non-associative operators such as float operations, at the cost of reduced performance.
* Added a parallel `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` device functions similar to `std::partial_sort` and `std::partial_sort_copy`. `partial_sort` and `partial_sort_copy` arrange elements such that the elements are in the same order as a sorted list up to and including the middle index.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* Modified the input size in device adjacent difference benchmarks. Observed performance with these benchmarks might be different.
* Changed the default seed for `device_benchmark_segmented_reduce`.

#### Removed

* `rocprim::thread_load()` and `rocprim::thread_store()` have been deprecated. Use `dereference()` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue in `rmake.py` where the list storing cmake options would contain individual characters instead of a full string of options.
* Resolved an issue in `rtest.py` where it crashed if the `build` folder was created without `release` or `debug` subdirectories.
* Resolved an issue with `rtest.py` on Windows where passing an absolute path to `--install_dir` caused a `FileNotFound` error.
* rocPRIM functions are no longer forcefully inlined on Windows. This significantly reduces the build time of debug builds.
* `block_load`, `block_store`, `block_shuffle`, `block_exchange`, and `warp_exchange` now use placement `new` instead of copy assignment (`operator=`) when writing to local memory. This fixes the behavior of custom types with non-trivial copy assignments.
* Fixed a bug in the generation of input data for benchmarks, which caused incorrect performance to be reported in specific cases. It may affect the reported performance for one-byte types (`uint8_t` and `int8_t`) and instantiations of `custom_type`. Specifically, device binary search, device histogram, device merge and warp sort are affected.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::merge_path_search` where using `unsigned` offsets would produce incorrect results.
* Fixed a bug for `rocprim::thread_load` and `rocprim::thread_store` where `float` and `double` were not cast to the correct type, resulting in incorrect results.
* Resolved an issue where tests were failing when they were compiled with `-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS=ON`.
* Resolved an issue where algorithms that used an internal serial merge routine caused a memory access fault that resulted in potential performance drops when using block sort, device merge sort (block merge), device merge, device partial sort, and device sort (merge sort).
* Fixed memory leaks in unit tests due to missing calls to `hipFree()` and the incorrect use of hipGraphs.
* Fixed an issue where certain inputs to `block_sort_merge()`, `device_merge_sort_merge_path()`, `device_merge()`, and `warp_sort_stable()` caused an assertion error during the call to `serial_merge()`.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Added

- JSON output plugin for `rocprofv2`. The JSON file matches Google Trace Format making it easy to load on Perfetto, Chrome tracing, or Speedscope. For Speedscope, use `--disable-json-data-flows` option as speedscope doesn't work with data flows.

- Updated `rocprofv3` `--help` options
- Changed naming of "agent profiling" to a more descriptive "device counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new name, use the following sed:
  ```
  find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/rocprofiler_agent_profile_callback_t/rocprofiler_device_counting_service_callback_t/g; s/rocprofiler_configure_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_configure_device_counting_service/g; s/agent_profile.h/device_counting_service.h/g; s/rocprofiler_sample_agent_profile_counting_service/rocprofiler_sample_device_counting_service/g' {} +
  ```
- Changed naming of "dispatch profiling service" to a more descriptive "dispatch counting service". To convert existing tool or user code to the new names, the following sed can be used:
  ```
  -type f -exec sed -i -e 's/dispatch_profile_counting_service/dispatch_counting_service/g' -e 's/dispatch_profile.h/dispatch_counting_service.h/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_callback_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_callback_t/g' -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_data_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_data_t/g'  -e 's/rocprofiler_profile_counting_dispatch_record_t/rocprofiler_dispatch_counting_service_record_t/g' {} +
  ```

* Fixed `rocsparse_Xgemmi` failures when the y grid dimension is too large. This occurred when `n >= 65536`.
* Fixed the gfortran dependency for the Azure Linux operating system.

### **rocThrust** (3.2.0)

#### Added

* Merged changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.3.2
  * Only the NVIDIA backend uses `tuple` and `pair` types from libcu++, other backends continue to use the original Thrust implementations and hence do not require libcu++ (CCCL) as a dependency.
* Added the `thrust::hip::par_det` execution policy to enable bitwise reproducibility on algorithms that are not bitwise reproducible by default.

#### Changed

* Changed the default value of `rmake.py -a` to `default_gpus`. This is equivalent to `gfx906:xnack-,gfx1030,gfx1100,gfx1101,gfx1102`.
* Enabled the upstream (thrust) test suite for execution by default. It can be disabled by using the `-DENABLE_UPSTREAM_TESTS=OFF` cmake option.

Loading Perfetto trace output `.proto` files in the latest version of `ui.perfetto.dev` can result in a dialog with the message, "Oops, something went wrong! Please file a bug." The information in the dialog will refer to an "Unknown field type." The workaround is to open the files with the previous version of the Perfetto UI found at [https://ui.perfetto.dev/v46.0-35b3d9845/#!/](https://ui.perfetto.dev/v46.0-35b3d9845/#!/).

See [issue #3767](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3767) on GitHub.

### **RCCL** (2.20.5)

#### Known issues

On systems running Linux kernel 6.8.0, such as Ubuntu 24.04, Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers between the GPU and NIC are disabled and impacts multi-node RCCL performance.
This issue was reproduced with RCCL 2.20.5 (ROCm 6.2.0 and 6.2.1) on systems with Broadcom Thor-2 NICs and affects other systems with RoCE networks using Linux 6.8.0 or newer.
Older RCCL versions are also impacted.

This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

See [issue #3772](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3772) on GitHub.

### **rocAL** (2.0.0)

#### Changed
 
* The new version of rocAL introduces many new features, but does not modify any of the existing public API functions.However, the version number was incremented from 1.3 to 2.0.

* Fixed an issue where the Compute Partition tests segfaulted when AMDGPU was loaded with optional parameters.

#### Known issues

* When setting CPX as a partition mode, there is a DRM node limit of 64. This is a known limitation when multiple drivers are using the DRM nodes. The `ls /sys/class/drm` command can be used to see the number of DRM nodes, and the following steps can be used to remove unnecessary drivers:

    1. Unload AMDGPU: `sudo rmmod amdgpu`.

On systems running Linux kernel 6.8.0, such as Ubuntu 24.04, Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers between the GPU and NIC are disabled and impacts multi-node RCCL performance.
This issue was reproduced with RCCL 2.20.5 (ROCm 6.2.0 and 6.2.1) on systems with Broadcom Thor-2 NICs and affects other systems with RoCE networks using Linux 6.8.0 or newer.
Older RCCL versions are also impacted.

This issue will be addressed in a future ROCm release.

See [issue #3772](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3772) on GitHub.

### **rocAL** (2.0.0)

#### Changed
 
* The new version of rocAL introduces many new features, but does not modify any of the existing public API functions.However, the version number was incremented from 1.3 to 2.0.
  Applications linked to version 1.3 must be recompiled to link against version 2.0.
* Added development and test packages.
* Added C++ rocAL audio unit test and Python script to run and compare the outputs.
* Added Python support for audio decoders.
* Added Pytorch iterator for audio.
* Added Python audio unit test and support to verify outputs.
* Added rocDecode for HW decode.
* Added support for: 
    * Audio loader and decoder, which uses libsndfile library to decode wav files
    * Audio augmentation - PreEmphasis filter, Spectrogram, ToDecibels, Resample, NonSilentRegionDetection, MelFilterBank 
    * Generic augmentation - Slice, Normalize
    * Reading from file lists in file reader
    * Downmixing audio channels during decoding
    * TensorTensorAdd and TensorScalarMultiply operations
    * Uniform and Normal distribution nodes
* Image to tensor updates
* ROCm install - use case graphics removed

#### Known issues
 
* Dependencies are not installed with the rocAL package installer. Dependencies must be installed with the prerequisite setup script provided. See the [rocAL README on GitHub](https://github.com/ROCm/rocAL/blob/docs/6.2.1/README.md#prerequisites-setup-script) for details.

### **rocBLAS** (4.2.1)

#### Removed

* Removed Device_Memory_Allocation.pdf link in documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed error/warning message during `rocblas_set_stream()` call.

### **rocFFT** (1.0.29)

#### Optimized

* Implemented 1D kernels for factorizable sizes less than 1024.

### **ROCm SMI** (7.3.0)

#### Optimized

* Improved handling of UnicodeEncodeErrors with non UTF-8 locales. Non UTF-8 locales were causing crashes on UTF-8 special characters.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed an issue where the Compute Partition tests segfaulted when AMDGPU was loaded with optional parameters.

#### Known issues

* When setting CPX as a partition mode, there is a DRM node limit of 64. This is a known limitation when multiple drivers are using the DRM nodes. The `ls /sys/class/drm` command can be used to see the number of DRM nodes, and the following steps can be used to remove unnecessary drivers:
        
    1. Unload AMDGPU: `sudo rmmod amdgpu`.
    2. Remove any unnecessary drivers using `rmmod`. For example, to remove an AST driver, run `sudo rmmod ast`.
    3. Reload AMDGPU using `modprobe`: `sudo modprobe amdgpu`.

### **rocPRIM** (3.2.1)

#### Optimized

* Improved performance of `block_reduce_warp_reduce` when warp size equals block size.

## ROCm 6.2.0

See the [ROCm 6.2.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.2.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (24.6.2)

#### Changed

- Added the following functionality:
  - `amd-smi dmon` is now available as an alias to `amd-smi monitor`.
  - An optional process table under `amd-smi monitor -q`.
  - Handling to detect VMs with passthrough configurations in CLI tool.
  - Process Isolation and Clear SRAM functionality to the CLI tool for VMs.
  - Added Ring Hang event.
- Added macros that were in `amdsmi.h` to the AMD SMI Python library `amdsmi_interface.py`.
- Renamed `amdsmi_set_gpu_clear_sram_data()` to `amdsmi_clean_gpu_local_data()`.

#### Removed

- Removed `throttle-status` from `amd-smi monitor` as it is no longer reliably supported.
- Removed elevated permission requirements for `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_list()`.

#### Optimized

- Updated CLI error strings to specify invalid device type queried.
- Multiple structure updates in `amdsmi.h` and `amdsmi_interface.py` to align with host/guest.
  - Added `amdsmi.h` and `amdsmi_interface.py`.
  - `amdsmi_clk_info_t` struct
  - Added `AMDSMI` prefix to multiple structures.
- Updated `dpm_policy` references to `soc_pstate`.
- Updated `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` product_name to fallback to `pciids` file.
- Updated `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` now has larger structure sizes for `amdsmi_board_info_t`.
- Updated CLI voltage curve command output.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed multiple processes not being registered in `amd-smi process` with JSON and CSV format.
- `amdsmi_get_gpu_board_info()` no longer returns junk character strings.
- Fixed parsing of `pp_od_clk_voltage` within `amdsmi_get_gpu_od_volt_info`.
- Fixed Leftover Mutex deadlock when running multiple instances of the CLI tool. When running
  `amd-smi reset --gpureset --gpu all` and then running an instance of `amd-smi static` (or any
  other subcommand that access the GPUs) a mutex would lock and not return requiring either a
  clear of the mutex in `/dev/shm` or rebooting the machine.

#### Known issues

- `amdsmi_get_gpu_process_isolation` and `amdsmi_clean_gpu_local_data` commands do not work.
  They will be supported in a future release.

See [issue #3500](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3500) on GitHub.

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Changed

- Added support for:
  - Permute scale for any dimension (#1198).
  - Combined elementwise op (#1217).
  - Multi D in grouped convolution backward weight (#1280).
  - K or C equal to 1 for `fp16` in grouped convolution backward weight (#1280).
  - Large batch in grouped convolution forward (#1332).
- Added `CK_TILE` layernorm example (#1339).
- `CK_TILE`-based Flash Attention 2 kernel is now merged into the upstream repository as ROCm backend.

#### Optimized

- Support universal GEMM in grouped convolution forward (#1320).
- Optimizations for low M and N in grouped convolution backward weight (#1303).
- Added a functional enhancement and compiler bug fix for FlashAttention Forward Kernel.
- `FP8` GEMM performance optimization and tuning (#1384).
- Added FlashAttention backward pass performance optimization (#1397).

### **HIP** (6.2.0)

#### Changed

- Added the `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`, `__all_sync()` and `__any_sync()`. These take
  a 64-bit integer as an explicit mask argument.
  - In HIP 6.2, these are hidden behind the preprocessor macro `HIP_ENABLE_WARP_SYNC_BUILTINS`, and will be enabled
    unconditionally in a future HIP release.

- Added new HIP APIs:
  - `hipGetProcAddress` returns the pointer to driver function, corresponding to the defined driver function symbol.
  - `hipGetFuncBySymbol` returns the pointer to device entry function that matches entry function `symbolPtr`.
  - `hipStreamBeginCaptureToGraph` begins graph capture on a stream to an existing graph.
  - `hipGraphInstantiateWithParams` creates an executable graph from a graph.

- Added a new flag `integrated` -- supported in device property.

  - The integrated flag is added in the struct `hipDeviceProp_t`. On the integrated APU system, the runtime driver
    detects and sets this flag to `1`, in which case the API `hipDeviceGetAttribute` returns enum `hipDeviceAttribute_t` for
    `hipDeviceAttributeIntegrated` as value 1, for integrated GPU device.

- Added initial support for 8-bit floating point datatype in `amd_hip_fp8.h`. These are accessible via `#include <hip/hip_fp8.h>`.

- Added UUID support for environment variable `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed stream capture support in HIP graphs. Prohibited and unhandled operations are fixed during stream capture in the HIP runtime.
- Fixed undefined symbol error for `hipTexRefGetArray` and `hipTexRefGetBorderColor`.

#### Upcoming changes

- The `_sync()` version of crosslane builtins such as `shfl_sync()`, `__all_sync()`, and `__any_sync()` will be enabled unconditionally in a future HIP release.

### **hipBLAS** (2.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added a new ILP64 API for level 2 functions for both C and FORTRAN (`_64` name suffix) with `int64_t` function arguments.
* Added a new ILP64 API for level 1 `_ex` functions.

* The `install.sh` script now invokes the `rmake.py` script. Made other various improvements to the build scripts.
* Changed library dependencies in the `install.sh` script from `rocblas` and `rocsolver` to the development packages
  `rocblas-dev` and `rocsolver-dev`.
* Updated Linux AOCL dependency to release 4.2 `gcc` build.
* Updated Windows `vcpkg` dependencies to release 2024.02.14.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.8.0)

#### Changed

* Added extension APIs:
  *`hipblasltExtAMaxWithScale`.
  * `GemmTuning` extension parameter to set `wgm` by user.
* Added support for:
  * `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_AMAX_D_POINTER` for `FP8`/`BF8` datatype.
  * `FP8`/`BF8` input, `FP32/FP16/BF16/F8/BF8` output (gfx94x platform only).
  * `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_COMPUTE_INPUT_TYPE_A_EXT` and `HIPBLASLT_MATMUL_DESC_COMPUTE_INPUT_TYPE_B_EXT` for `FP16` input data type to use `FP8`/`BF8` MFMA.
* Added support for gfx110x.

#### Optimized

* Improved library loading time.

### **HIPCC** (1.1.1)

#### Changed

* Split `hipcc` package into two packages for different hardware platforms.

* Cleaned up references to environment variables.

* Enabled `hipcc` and `hipconfig` binaries (`hipcc.bin`, `hipconfig.bin`) by
  default, instead of their Perl counterparts.

* Enabled function calls.

* Added support for generating packages for ROCm stack targeting static libraries.

#### Resolved issues

* Implemented numerous bug fixes and quality improvements.

### **hipCUB** (3.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added `DeviceCopy` function for parity with CUB.
* Added `enum WarpExchangeAlgorithm` to the rocPRIM backend, which is used as
  the new optional template argument for `WarpExchange`.
  * The potential values for the enum are `WARP_EXCHANGE_SMEM` and
    `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE`.
  * `WARP_EXCHANGE_SMEM` stands for the previous algorithm, while
    `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE` performs the exchange via shuffle operations.
  * `WARP_EXCHANGE_SHUFFLE` does not require any pre-allocated shared memory,
    but the `ItemsPerThread` must be a divisor of `WarpSize`.
* Added `tuple.hpp` which defines templates `hipcub::tuple`,
  `hipcub::tuple_element`, `hipcub::tuple_element_t` and `hipcub::tuple_size`.
* Added new overloaded member functions to `BlockRadixSort` and
  `DeviceRadixSort` that expose a `decomposer` argument. Keys of a custom type
  (`key_type`) can be sorted via these overloads, if an appropriate decomposer
  is passed. The decomposer has to implement `operator(const key_type&)` which
  returns a `hipcub::tuple` of references pointing to members of `key_type`.

* On AMD GPUs (using the HIP backend), you can now issue hipCUB API calls inside of
  HIP graphs, with several exceptions:
   * `CachingDeviceAllocator`
   * `GridBarrierLifetime`
   * `DeviceSegmentedRadixSort`
   * `DeviceRunLengthEncode`
  Currently, these classes rely on one or more synchronous calls to function correctly. Because of this, they cannot be used inside of HIP graphs.

#### Removed

* Deprecated `debug_synchronous` in hipCUB-2.13.2, and it no longer has any effect. With this release, passing `debug_synchronous`
  to the device functions results in a deprecation warning both at runtime and at compile time.
  * The synchronization that was previously achievable by passing `debug_synchronous=true` can now be achieved at compile time
    by setting the `CUB_DEBUG_SYNC` (or higher debug level) or the `HIPCUB_DEBUG_SYNC` preprocessor definition.
  * The compile time deprecation warnings can be disabled by defining the `HIPCUB_IGNORE_DEPRECATED_API` preprocessor definition.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed the derivation for the accumulator type for device scan algorithms in the rocPRIM backend being different compared to CUB.
  It now derives the accumulator type as the result of the binary operator.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.15)

#### Resolved issues

* Added `hip::host` as a public link library, as `hipfft.h` includes HIP runtime headers.
* Prevented C++ exceptions leaking from public API functions.
* Made output of `hipfftXt` match `cufftXt` in geometry and alignment for 2D and 3D FFTs.

### **HIPIFY** (18.0.0)

#### Changed

- Added support for:
  - NVIDIA CUDA 12.4.1
  - cuDNN 9.1.1
  - LLVM 18.1.6
- Added full hipBLASLt support.

#### Resolved issues

- HIPIFY now applies `reinterpret_cast` for an explicit conversion between pointer-to-function and pointer-to-object;
  affected functions: `hipFuncGetAttributes`, `hipFuncSetAttribute`, `hipFuncSetCacheConfig`, `hipFuncSetSharedMemConfig`, `hipLaunchKernel`, and `hipLaunchCooperativeKernel`.

### **hipRAND** (2.11.0)

#### Changed

* Added support for setting generator output ordering in C and C++ API.
* `hiprandCreateGeneratorHost` dispatches to the host generator in the rocRAND backend instead of returning with
  `uHIPRAND_STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`.
* Added options to create:
  * A host generator to the Fortran wrapper.
  * A host generator to the Python wrapper.
* Previously, for internal testing with HMM the environment variable `ROCRAND_USE_HMM` was used in previous
  versions. The environment variable is now named `HIPRAND_USE_HMM`.
* Static library -- moved all internal symbols to namespaces to avoid potential symbol name collisions when linking.
* Device API documentation is improved in this version.

#### Removed

* Removed the option to build hipRAND as a submodule to rocRAND.
* Removed references to, and workarounds for, the deprecated `hcc`.
* Removed support for finding rocRAND based on the environment variable `ROCRAND_DIR`.
  Use `ROCRAND_PATH` instead.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed a build error when using Clang++ directly due to unsupported references to `amdgpu-target`.

### **hipSOLVER** (2.2.0)

#### Changed

- Added compatibility-only functions:
  - `auxiliary`
    - `hipsolverDnCreateParams`, `hipsolverDnDestroyParams`, `hipsolverDnSetAdvOptions`
  - `getrf`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrf_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrf`
  - `getrs`
    - `hipsolverDnXgetrs`
- Added support for building on Ubuntu 24.04 and CBL-Mariner.
- Added `hip::host` to `roc::hipsolver` usage requirements.
- Added functions
  - `syevdx`/`heevdx`
    - `hipsolverSsyevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverDsyevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverCheevdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverZheevdx_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverSsyevdx`, `hipsolverDsyevdx`, `hipsolverCheevdx`, `hipsolverZheevdx`
  - `sygvdx`/`hegvdx`
    - `hipsolverSsygvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverDsygvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverChegvdx_bufferSize`, `hipsolverZhegvdx_bufferSize`
    - `hipsolverSsygvdx`, `hipsolverDsygvdx`, `hipsolverChegvdx`, `hipsolverZhegvdx`

- Updated `csrlsvchol` to perform numerical factorization on the GPU. The symbolic factorization is still performed on the CPU.
- Renamed `hipsolver-compat.h` to `hipsolver-dense.h`.

#### Removed

- Removed dependency on `cblas` from the hipSOLVER test and benchmark clients.

### **hipSPARSE** (3.1.1)

#### Changed

* Added the missing `hipsparseCscGet()` routine.

* All internal hipSPARSE functions now exist inside a namespace.
* Match deprecations found in cuSPARSE 12.x.x when using cuSPARSE backend.
* Improved the user manual and contribution guidelines.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed `SpGEMM` and `SpGEMM_reuse` routines that were not matching cuSPARSE behavior.

#### Known issues

* In `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`, the external buffer is currently passed as a parameter. This does not match the cuSPARSE API
  and this extra external buffer parameter will be removed in a future release. For now this extra parameter can be
  ignored and passed a `nullptr` as it is unused internally by `hipsparseSpSM_solve()`.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.2.1)

#### Optimized

* Refined test cases.

### **hipTensor** (1.3.0)

#### Changed

* Added support for:
  * Tensor permutation of ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  * Tensor contraction of M6N6K6: M, N, K up to rank 6
* Added tests for:
  * Tensor permutation of ranks of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  * Tensor contraction of M6N6K6: M, N, K up to rank 6
  * YAML parsing to support sequential parameters ordering.
* Prefer `amd-llvm-devel` package before system LLVM library.
* Preferred compilers changed to `CC=amdclang` `CXX=amdclang++`.
* Updated actor-critic selection for new contraction kernel additions.
* Updated installation, programmer's guide, and API reference documentation.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed LLVM parsing crash.
* Fixed memory consumption issue in complex kernels.
* Workaround implemented for compiler crash during debug build.
* Allow random modes ordering for tensor contractions.

### **llvm-project** (18.0.0)

#### Changed

* LLVM IR

  * The `llvm.stacksave` and `llvm.stackrestore` intrinsics now use an overloaded pointer type to support non-0 address
    spaces.

  * Added `llvm.exp10` intrinsic.

* LLVM infrastructure

  * The minimum Clang version to build LLVM in C++20 configuration is now `clang-17.0.6`.

* TableGen

  * Added constructs for debugging TableGen files:

    * `dump` keyword to dump messages to standard error. See [#68793](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/68793).

    * `!repr` bang operator to inspect the content of values. See [#68716](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/68716).

* AArch64 backend

  * Added support for Cortex-A520, Cortex-A720 and Cortex-X4 CPUs.

* AMDGPU backend

  * `llvm.sqrt.f32` is now lowered correctly. Use `llvm.amdgcn.sqrt.f32` for raw instruction access.

  * Implemented `llvm.stacksave` and `llvm.stackrestore` intrinsics.

  * Implemented `llvm.get.rounding`.

* ARM backend

  * Added support for Cortex-M52 CPUs.

  * Added execute-only support for Armv6-M.

* RISC-V backend

  * The `Zfa` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental.

  * `Zihintntl` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental.

  * Intrinsics were added for `Zk*`, `Zbb`, and `Zbc`. See
    [Scalar Bit Manipulation Extension Intrinsics](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-c-api-doc/blob/main/src/c-api.adoc#scalar-bit-manipulation-extension-intrinsics) in the RISC-V C API specification.

  * Default ABI with F but without D was changed to ilp32f for RV32 and to lp64f for RV64.

  * The `Zvbb`, `Zvbc`, `Zvkb`, `Zvkg`, `Zvkn`, `Zvknc`, `Zvkned`, `Zvkng`, `Zvknha`, `Zvknhb`, `Zvks`, `Zvksc`,
    `Zvksed`, `Zvksg`, `Zvksh`, and `Zvkt` extension version was upgraded to 1.0 and is no longer experimental. However,
    the C intrinsics for these extensions are still experimental. To use the C intrinsics for these extensions,
    `-menable-experimental-extensions` needs to be passed to Clang.

  * `-mcpu=sifive-p450` was added.

  * CodeGen of `RV32E` and `RV64E` is supported experimentally.

  * CodeGen of `ilp32e` and `lp64e` is supported experimentally.

* X86 backend

  * Added support for the RDMSRLIST and WRMSRLIST instructions.

  * Added support for the WRMSRNS instruction.

  * Support ISA of AMX-FP16 which contains `tdpfp16ps` instruction.

  * Support ISA of CMPCCXADD.

  * Support ISA of AVX-IFMA.

  * Support ISA of AVX-VNNI-INT8.

  * Support ISA of AVX-NE-CONVERT.

  * `-mcpu=raptorlake`, `-mcpu=meteorlake` and `-mcpu=emeraldrapids` are now supported.

  * `-mcpu=sierraforest`, `-mcpu=graniterapids` and `-mcpu=grandridge` are now supported.

  * `__builtin_unpredictable` (unpredictable metadata in LLVM IR), is handled by X86 Backend. X86CmovConversion pass now
    respects this builtin and does not convert CMOVs to branches.

  * Add support for the PBNDKB instruction.

  * Support ISA of SHA512.

  * Support ISA of SM3.

  * Support ISA of SM4.

  * Support ISA of AVX-VNNI-INT16.

  * `-mcpu=graniterapids-d` is now supported.

  * The `i128` type now matches GCC and clang’s `__int128` type. This mainly benefits external projects such as Rust
    which aim to be binary compatible with C, but also fixes code generation where LLVM already assumed that the type
    matched and called into `libgcc` helper functions.

  * Support ISA of USER_MSR.

  * Support ISA of AVX10.1-256 and AVX10.1-512.

  * `-mcpu=pantherlake` and `-mcpu=clearwaterforest` are now supported.

  * `-mapxf` is supported.

  * Marking global variables with `code_model = "small"/"large"` in the IR now overrides the global code model to allow
    32-bit relocations or require 64-bit relocations to the global variable.

  * The medium code model’s code generation was audited to be more similar to the small code model where possible.

* C API

  * Added `LLVMGetTailCallKind` and `LLVMSetTailCallKind` to allow getting and setting `tail`, `musttail`, and `notail` attributes on call instructions.

  * Added `LLVMCreateTargetMachineWithOptions`, along with helper functions for an opaque option structure, as an
    alternative to `LLVMCreateTargetMachine`. The option structure exposes an additional setting (that is, the target
    ABI) and provides default values for unspecified settings.

  * Added `LLVMGetNNeg` and `LLVMSetNNeg` for getting and setting the new `nneg` flag on zext instructions, and
    `LLVMGetIsDisjoint` and `LLVMSetIsDisjoint` for getting and setting the new disjoint flag on or instructions.

  * Added the following functions for manipulating operand bundles, as well as building call and invoke instructions
    that use operand bundles:

    * `LLVMBuildCallWithOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMBuildInvokeWithOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMCreateOperandBundle`

    * `LLVMDisposeOperandBundle`

    * `LLVMGetNumOperandBundles`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleAtIndex`

    * `LLVMGetNumOperandBundleArgs`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleArgAtIndex`

    * `LLVMGetOperandBundleTag`

  * Added `LLVMGetFastMathFlags` and `LLVMSetFastMathFlags` for getting and setting the fast-math flags of an
    instruction, as well as `LLVMCanValueUseFastMathFlags` for checking if an instruction can use such flag.

* CodeGen infrastructure

  * A new debug type `isel-dump` is added to show only the SelectionDAG dumps after each ISel phase (i.e.
    `-debug-only=isel-dump`). This new debug type can be filtered by function names using
    `-filter-print-funcs=<function names>`, the same flag used to filter IR dumps after each Pass. Note that the
    existing `-debug-only=isel` will take precedence over the new behavior and print SelectionDAG dumps of every single
    function regardless of `-filter-print-funcs`’s values.

* Metadata info

  * Added a new loop metadata `!{!”llvm.loop.align”, i32 64}`.

* LLVM tools

  * `llvm-symbolizer` now treats invalid input as an address for which source information is not found.

  * `llvm-readelf` now supports `--extra-sym-info` (-X) to display extra information (section name) when showing
    symbols.

  * `llvm-readobj --elf-output-style=JSON` no longer prefixes each JSON object with the file name. Previously, each
    object file’s output looked like `"main.o":{"FileSummary":{"File":"main.o"},...}` but is now
    `{"FileSummary":{"File":"main.o"},...}`. This allows each JSON object to be parsed in the same way, since each
    object no longer has a unique key. Tools that consume `llvm-readobj`’s JSON output should update their parsers
    accordingly.

  * `llvm-objdump` now uses `--print-imm-hex` by default, which brings its default behavior closer in line with `objdump`.

  * `llvm-nm` now supports the `--line-numbers` (`-l`) option to use debugging information to print symbols’ filenames and line numbers.

  * `llvm-symbolizer` and `llvm-addr2line` now support addresses specified as symbol names.

  * `llvm-objcopy` now supports `--gap-fill` and `--pad-to` options, for ELF input and binary output files only.

* LLDB

  * `SBType::FindDirectNestedType` function is added. It’s useful for formatters to quickly find directly nested type
    when it’s known where to search for it, avoiding more expensive global search via `SBTarget::FindFirstType`.

  * Renamed `lldb-vscode` to `lldb-dap` and updated its installation instructions to reflect this. The underlying
    functionality remains unchanged.

  * The `mte_ctrl` register can now be read from AArch64 Linux core files.

  * LLDB on AArch64 Linux now supports debugging the Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) and Scalable Matrix Extension 2
    (SME2) for both live processes and core files. For details refer to the AArch64 Linux documentation.

  * LLDB now supports symbol and binary acquisition automatically using the DEBUFINFOD protocol. The standard mechanism
    of specifying DEBUFINOD servers in the DEBUGINFOD_URLS environment variable is used by default. In addition, users
    can specify servers to request symbols from using the LLDB setting `plugin.symbol-locator.debuginfod.server_urls`,
    override or adding to the environment variable.

  * When running on AArch64 Linux, `lldb-server` now provides register field information for the following registers:
    `cpsr`, `fpcr`, `fpsr`, `svcr` and `mte_ctrl`.

* Sanitizers

  * HWASan now defaults to detecting use-after-scope bugs.

#### Removals

* LLVM IR

  * The constant expression variants of the following instructions have been removed:

    * `and`

    * `or`

    * `lshr`

    * `ashr`

    * `zext`

    * `sext`

    * `fptrunc`

    * `fpext`

    * `fptoui`

    * `fptosi`

    * `uitofp`

    * `sitofp`

* RISC-V backend

  * XSfcie extension and SiFive CSRs and instructions that were associated with it have been removed. None of these CSRs and
    instructions were part of “SiFive Custom Instruction Extension”. The LLVM project needs to work with
    SiFive to define and document real extension names for individual CSRs and instructions.

* Python bindings

  * The Python bindings have been removed.

* C API

  * The following functions for creating constant expressions have been removed, because the underlying constant
    expressions are no longer supported. Instead, an instruction should be created using the `LLVMBuildXYZ` APIs, which
    will constant fold the operands if possible and create an instruction otherwise:

    * `LLVMConstAnd`

    * `LLVMConstOr`

    * `LLVMConstLShr`

    * `LLVMConstZExt`

    * `LLVMConstSExt`

    * `LLVMConstZExtOrBitCast`

    * `LLVMConstFPCast`

* CodeGen infrastructure

  * `PrologEpilogInserter` no longer supports register scavenging during forwards frame index elimination. Targets
    should use backwards frame index elimination instead.

  * `RegScavenger` no longer supports forwards register scavenging. Clients should use backwards register scavenging
    instead, which is preferred because it does not depend on accurate kill flags.

* LLDB

  * `SBWatchpoint::GetHardwareIndex` is deprecated and now returns `-1` to indicate the index is unavailable.

  * Methods in `SBHostOS` related to threads have had their implementations removed. These methods will return a value
    indicating failure.

#### Resolved issues

* AArch64 backend

  * Neoverse-N2 was incorrectly marked as an Armv8.5a core. This has been changed to an Armv9.0a core. However, crypto
    options are not enabled by default for Armv9 cores, so `-mcpu=neoverse-n2+crypto` is now required to enable crypto for
    this core. As far as the compiler is concerned, Armv9.0a has the same features enabled as Armv8.5a, with the
    exception of crypto.

* Windows target

  * The LLVM filesystem class `UniqueID` and function `equivalent`() no longer determine that distinct different path
    names for the same hard linked file actually are equal. This is an intentional tradeoff in a bug fix, where the bug
    used to cause distinct files to be considered equivalent on some file systems. This change fixed the GitHub issues
    [#61401](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/61401) and [#22079](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/22079).

#### Known issues

The compiler may incorrectly compile a program that uses the
``__shfl(var, srcLane, width)`` function when one of the parameters to
the function is undefined along some path to the function. For most functions,
uninitialized inputs cause undefined behavior.

```{note}
The ``-Wall`` compilation flag prompts the compiler to generate a warning if a variable is uninitialized along some path.
```

As a workaround, initialize the parameters to ``__shfl``. For example:

```{code-block} cpp
unsigned long istring = 0 // Initialize the input to __shfl
return __shfl(istring, 0, 64)
```

- Fixed issues with dependencies.

#### Known issues

- MIVisionX package install requires manual prerequisites installation.

### **Omniperf** (2.0.1)

#### Known issues

- Error when running Omniperf with an application with command line arguments. As a workaround, create an
  intermediary script to call the application with the necessary arguments, then call the script with Omniperf. This
  issue is fixed in a future release of Omniperf. See [#347](https://github.com/ROCm/rocprofiler-compute/issues/347).

- Omniperf might not work with AMD Instinct MI300 accelerators out of the box, resulting in the following error:
  "*ERROR gfx942 is not enabled rocprofv1. Available profilers include: ['rocprofv2']*". As a workaround, add the
  environment variable `export ROCPROF=rocprofv2`.

- Omniperf's Python dependencies may not be installed with your ROCm installation, resulting in the following message:

  "*[ERROR] The 'dash>=1.12.0' package was not found in the current execution environment.*

  *[ERROR] The 'dash-bootstrap-components' package was not found in the current execution environment.*

  *Please verify all of the Python dependencies called out in the requirements file are installed locally prior to running omniperf.*

  *See: /opt/rocm-6.2.0/libexec/omniperf/requirements.txt*"

  As a workaround, install these Python requirements manually: `pip install /opt/rocm-6.2.0/libexec/omniperf/requirements.txt`.

See [issue #3498](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/3498) on GitHub.

### **ROCdbgapi** (0.76.0)

#### Removed

- Renamed `(AMD_DBGAPI_EXCEPTION_WAVE,AMD_DBGAPI_WAVE_STOP_REASON)_APERTURE_VIOLATION` to `(AMD_DBGAPI_EXCEPTION_WAVE,AMD_DBGAPI_WAVE_STOP_REASON)_ADDRESS_ERROR`.
  The old names are still accessible but deprecated.

### **rocDecode** (0.6.0)

#### Changed

- Added full H.264 support and bug fixes.

### **rocFFT** (1.0.28)

#### Changed

* Randomly generated accuracy tests are now disabled by default. They can be enabled using
  the `--nrand` option (which defaults to 0).

#### Optimized

```{note}
See the [detailed ROCm SMI changelog](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm_smi_lib/blob/docs/6.2.0/CHANGELOG.md)
on GitHub for more information.
```

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.0.0)

  * IET (power) stress test for MI300A.

  * IET (power transition) test for MI300X.

* Added support:

  * GEMM self-check and accuracy-check support for checking consistency and accuracy of GEMM output.

  * Trignometric float and random integer matrix data initialization support.

* Updated GST performance benchmark test for better numbers.

### **rocPRIM** (3.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added new overloads for `warp_scan::exclusive_scan` that take no initial value. These new overloads will write an unspecified result to the first value of each warp.
* The internal accumulator type of `inclusive_scan(_by_key)` and `exclusive_scan(_by_key)` is now exposed as an optional type parameter.
  * The default accumulator type is still the value type of the input iterator (inclusive scan) or the initial value's type (exclusive scan).
    This is the same behaviour as before this change.
* Added a new overload for `device_adjacent_difference_inplace` that allows separate input and output iterators, but allows them to point to the same element.
* Added new public APIs for deriving resulting type on device-only functions:
  * `rocprim::invoke_result`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_t`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op`
  * `rocprim::invoke_result_binary_op_t`
* Added the new `rocprim::batch_copy` function. Similar to `rocprim::batch_memcpy`, but copies by element, not with memcpy.
* Added more test cases, to better cover supported data types.
* Added an optional `decomposer` argument for all member functions of `rocprim::block_radix_sort` and all functions of `device_radix_sort`.
  To sort keys of an user-defined type, a decomposer functor should be passed. The decomposer should produce a `rocprim::tuple`
  of references to arithmetic types from the key.
* Added `rocprim::predicate_iterator` which acts as a proxy for an underlying iterator based on a predicate.
  It iterates over proxies that holds the references to the underlying values, but only allow reading and writing if the predicate is `true`.
  It can be instantiated with:
  * `rocprim::make_predicate_iterator`
  * `rocprim::make_mask_iterator`
* Added custom radix sizes as the last parameter for `block_radix_sort`. The default value is 4, it can be a number between 0 and 32.
* Added `rocprim::radix_key_codec`, which allows the encoding/decoding of keys for radix-based sorts. For user-defined key types, a decomposer functor should be passed.
* Updated some tests to work with supported data types.

#### Removed

* Deprecated the internal header `detail/match_result_type.hpp`.
* Deprecated `TwiddleIn` and `TwiddleOut` in favor of `radix_key_codec`.
* Deprecated the internal `::rocprim::detail::radix_key_codec` in favor of a new public utility with the same name.

#### Optimized

* Improved the performance of `warp_sort_shuffle` and `block_sort_bitonic`.
* Created an optimized version of the `warp_exchange` functions `blocked_to_striped_shuffle` and `striped_to_blocked_shuffle` when the warpsize is equal to the items per thread.

#### Resolved issues

* Fixed incorrect results of `warp_exchange::blocked_to_striped_shuffle` and `warp_exchange::striped_to_blocked_shuffle` when the block size is
  larger than the logical warp size. The test suite has been updated with such cases.
* Fixed incorrect results returned when calling device `unique_by_key` with overlapping `values_input` and `values_output`.
* Fixed incorrect output type used in `device_adjacent_difference`.
* Fixed an issue causing incorrect results on the GFX10 (RDNA1, RDNA2) ISA and GFX11 ISA on device scan algorithms `rocprim::inclusive_scan(_by_key)` and `rocprim::exclusive_scan(_by_key)` with large input types.
* Fixed an issue with `device_adjacent_difference`. It now considers both the
  input and the output type for selecting the appropriate kernel launch config.
  Previously only the input type was considered, which could result in compilation errors due to excessive shared memory usage.
* Fixed incorrect data being loaded with `rocprim::thread_load` when compiling with `-O0`.
* Fixed a compilation failure in the host compiler when instantiating various block and device algorithms with block sizes not divisible by 64.

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0.0)

#### Removed

- Removed `pcsampler` sample code due to deprecation from version 2.

### **rocRAND** (3.1.0)

#### Changed

* Added `rocrand_create_generator_host`.
  * The following generators are supported:
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MRG31K3P`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MRG32K3A`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_PHILOX4_32_10`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY2_32_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY2_64_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY4_32_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_THREEFRY4_64_20`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_XORWOW`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SOBOL32`
    * `ROCRAND_RNG_QUASI_SOBOL64`
  * The host-side generators support multi-core processing. On Linux, this requires the TBB (Thread Building Blocks) development package to be installed on the system when building rocRAND (`libtbb-dev` on Ubuntu and derivatives).
    * If TBB is not found when configuring rocRAND, the configuration is still successful, and the host generators are executed on a single CPU thread.
* Added the option to create a host generator to the Python wrapper.
* Added the option to create a host generator to the Fortran wrapper
* Added dynamic ordering. This ordering is free to rearrange the produced numbers,
  which can be specific to devices and distributions. It is implemented for:
  * XORWOW, MRG32K3A, MTGP32, Philox 4x32-10, MRG31K3P, LFSR113, and ThreeFry
* Added support for using Clang as the host compiler for alternative platform compilation.
* C++ wrapper:
  * Added support for `lfsr113_engine` being constructed with a seed of type `unsigned long long`, not only `uint4`.
  * Added optional order parameter to the constructor of `mt19937_engine`.
* Added the following functions for the `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MTGP32` generator:
  * `rocrand_normal2`
  * `rocrand_normal_double2`
  * `rocrand_log_normal2`
  * `rocrand_log_normal_double2`
* Added `rocrand_create_generator_host_blocking` which dispatches without stream semantics.
* Added host-side generator for `ROCRAND_RNG_PSEUDO_MTGP32`.
* Added offset and skipahead functionality to LFSR113 generator.
* Added dynamic ordering for architecture `gfx1102`.

* For device-side generators, you can now wrap calls to `rocrand_generate_*` inside of a hipGraph. There are a few
  things to be aware of:
  - Generator creation (`rocrand_create_generator`), initialization (`rocrand_initialize_generator`), and destruction (`rocrand_destroy_generator`) must still happen outside the hipGraph.
  - After the generator is created, you may call API functions to set its seed, offset, and order.
  - After the generator is initialized (but before stream capture or manual graph creation begins), use `rocrand_set_stream` to set the stream the generator will use within the graph.
  - A generator's seed, offset, and stream may not be changed from within the hipGraph. Attempting to do so may result in unpredictable behaviour.
  - API calls for the poisson distribution (for example, `rocrand_generate_poisson`) are not yet supported inside of hipGraphs.
  - For sample usage, see the unit tests in `test/test_rocrand_hipgraphs.cpp`
* Building rocRAND now requires a C++17 capable compiler, as the internal library sources now require it. However consuming rocRAND is still possible from C++11 as public headers don't make use of the new features.
* Building rocRAND should be faster on machines with multiple CPU cores as the library has been
  split to multiple compilation units.
* C++ wrapper: the `min()` and `max()` member functions of the generators and distributions are now `static constexpr`.
* Renamed and unified the existing `ROCRAND_DETAIL_.*_BM_NOT_IN_STATE` to `ROCRAND_DETAIL_BM_NOT_IN_STATE`
* Static and dynamic library: moved all internal symbols to namespaces to avoid potential symbol name collisions when linking.

#### Removed

* Deprecated the following typedefs. Please use the unified `state_type` alias instead.
  * `rocrand_device::threefry2x32_20_engine::threefry2x32_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry2x64_20_engine::threefry2x64_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry4x32_20_engine::threefry4x32_20_state`
  * `rocrand_device::threefry4x64_20_engine::threefry4x64_20_state`
* Deprecated the following internal headers:
  * `src/rng/distribution/distributions.hpp`.
  * `src/rng/device_engines.hpp`.
* Removed references to and workarounds for deprecated hcc.
* Removed support for HIP-CPU.

#### Known issues

- `SOBOL64` and `SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64` generate poisson-distributed `unsigned long long int` numbers instead of `unsigned int`. This will be fixed in a future release.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.14.0)

#### Changed

- Added PC sampling feature (experimental feature).

### **rocSOLVER** (3.26.0)

#### Changed

  - SYEVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
  - HEEVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
- Added partial generalized symmetric/hermitian-definite eigenvalue decomposition using Divide & Conquer and Bisection:
  - SYGVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
  - HEGVDX (with `batched` and `strided_batched` versions)
- Renamed install script arguments of the form `*_dir to *-path`. Arguments of the form `*_dir` remain functional for
  backwards compatibility.
- Functions working with arrays of size n - 1 can now accept null pointers when n = 1.

#### Optimized

- Improved performance of Cholesky factorization.
- Improved performance of `splitlu` to extract the L and U triangular matrices from the result of sparse factorization matrix M, where M = (L - eye) + U.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed potential accuracy degradation in SYEVJ/HEEVJ for inputs with small eigenvalues.

### **rocSPARSE** (3.2.0)

#### Changed

* Added a new Merge-Path algorithm to SpMM, supporting CSR format.
* Added support for row order to SpSM.
* Added rocsparseio I/O functionality to the library.
* Added `rocsparse_set_identity_permutation`.

* Adjusted rocSPARSE dependencies to related HIP packages.
* Binary size has been reduced.
* A namespace has been wrapped around internal rocSPARSE functions and kernels.
* `rocsparse_csr_set_pointers`, `rocsparse_csc_set_pointers`, and `rocsparse_bsr_set_pointers` now allow the column indices and values arrays to be nullptr if `nnz` is 0.
* gfx803 target has been removed from address sanitizer builds.

#### Optimized

### **rocThrust** (3.1.0)

#### Changed

* Added changes from upstream CCCL/thrust 2.2.0.
  * Updated the contents of `system/hip` and `test` with the upstream changes.
* Updated internal calls to `rocprim::detail::invoke_result` to use the public API `rocprim::invoke_result`.
* Updated to use `rocprim::device_adjacent_difference` for `adjacent_difference` API call.
* Updated internal use of custom iterator in `thrust::detail::unique_by_key` to use rocPRIM's `rocprim::unique_by_key`.
* Updated `adjecent_difference` to make use of `rocprim:adjecent_difference` when iterators are comparable and not equal otherwise use `rocprim:adjacent_difference_inplace`.

#### Known issues

* `thrust::reduce_by_key` outputs are not bit-wise reproducible, as run-to-run results for pseudo-associative reduction operators (e.g. floating-point arithmetic operators) are not deterministic on the same device.
* Note that currently, rocThrust memory allocation is performed in such a way that most algorithmic API functions cannot be called from within hipGraphs.

### **rocWMMA** (1.5.0)

#### Changed

* Added internal utilities for:
  * Element-wise vector transforms.
  * Cross-lane vector transforms.
* Added internal aos<->soa transforms for block sizes of 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 and vector widths of 2, 4, 8 and 16.

```

## ROCm 6.1.0

See the [ROCm 6.1.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.1.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (24.4.1)

#### Added

* New monitor command for GPU metrics.
  Use the monitor command to customize, capture, collect, and observe GPU metrics on
  target devices.

* Integration with E-SMI.
  The EPYC™ System Management Interface In-band Library is a Linux C-library that provides in-band
  user space software APIs to monitor and control your CPU’s power, energy, performance, and other
  system management functionality. This integration enables access to CPU metrics and telemetry
  through the AMD SMI API and CLI tools.

### **Composable Kernel** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* New architecture support.
  CK now supports to the following architectures to enable efficient image denoising on the following
  AMD GPUs: gfx1030, gfx1100, gfx1031, gfx1101, gfx1032, gfx1102, gfx1034, gfx1103, gfx1035,
  gfx1036

#### Changed

* FP8 rounding logic is replaced with stochastic rounding.
  Stochastic rounding mimics a more realistic data behavior and improves model convergence.

### **HIP** (6.1)

#### Added

* New environment variable to enable kernel run serialization.
  The default `HIP_LAUNCH_BLOCKING` value is `0` (disable); which causes kernels to run as defined in
  the queue. When set to `1` (enable), the HIP runtime serializes the kernel queue, which behaves the
  same as `AMD_SERIALIZE_KERNEL`.

### **hipBLASLt** (0.7.0)

#### Added

* New GemmTuning extension parameter. GemmTuning allows you to set a split-k value for each solution, which is more feasible for
  performance tuning.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.14)

#### Added

* New multi-GPU support for single-process transforms. Multiple GPUs can be used to perform a transform in a single process. Note that this initial
  implementation is a functional preview.

### **HIPIFY** (17.0.0)

#### Changed

* Skipped code blocks: Code blocks that are skipped by the preprocessor are no longer hipified under the
  `--default-preprocessor` option. To hipify everything, despite conditional preprocessor directives
  (`#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, or `#else`), don't use the `--default-preprocessor` or `--amap` options.

### **hipSPARSELt** (0.1.0)

#### Added

* Structured sparsity matrix support extensions.
  Structured sparsity matrices help speed up deep-learning workloads. We now support `B` as the
  sparse matrix and `A` as the dense matrix in Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication (SPMM). Prior to this
  release, we only supported sparse (matrix A) x dense (matrix B) matrix multiplication. Structured
  sparsity matrices help speed up deep learning workloads.

### **hipTensor** (1.2.0)

#### Added

* 4D tensor permutation and contraction support.
  You can now perform tensor permutation on 4D tensors and 4D contractions for F16, BF16, and
  Complex F32/F64 datatypes.

### **llvm-project** (17.0.0)

#### Changed

* Combined projects. ROCm Device-Libs, ROCm Compiler Support, and hipCC are now located in
  the `llvm-project/amd` subdirectory of AMD's fork of the LLVM project. Previously, these projects
  were maintained in separate repositories. Note that the projects themselves will continue to be
  packaged separately.

* Split the `rocm-llvm` package. This package has been split into a required and an optional package: 

  * **rocm-llvm(required)**: A package containing the essential binaries needed for compilation.

  * **rocm-llvm-dev(optional)**: A package containing binaries for compiler and application developers.

### **MIGraphX** (2.9.0)

#### Added

* Improved performance for transformer-based models.
  We added support for FlashAttention, which benefits models like BERT, GPT, and Stable Diffusion.

* New Torch-MIGraphX driver.
  This driver calls MIGraphX directly from PyTorch. It provides an `mgx_module` object that you can
  invoke like any other Torch module, but which utilizes the MIGraphX inference engine internally.
  Torch-MIGraphX supports FP32, FP16, and INT8 datatypes.

* FP8 support. We now offer functional support for inference in the FP8E4M3FNUZ datatype. You
  can load an ONNX model in FP8E4M3FNUZ using C++ or Python APIs, or `migraphx-driver`.
  You can quantize a floating point model to FP8 format by using the `--fp8` flag with `migraphx-driver`.
  To accelerate inference, MIGraphX uses hardware acceleration on MI300 for FP8 by leveraging FP8
  support in various backend kernel libraries.

### **MIOpen** (3.1.0)

#### Added

* Improved performance for inference and convolutions.
  Inference support now provided for Find 2.0 fusion plans. Additionally, we've enhanced the Number of
  samples, Height, Width, and Channels (NHWC) convolution kernels for heuristics. NHWC stores data
  in a format where the height and width dimensions come first, followed by channels.

### **OpenMP** (17.60.0)

#### Added

* New MI300 FP atomics. Application performance can now improve by leveraging fast floating-point atomics on MI300 (gfx942).

#### Changed

* Implicit Zero-copy is triggered automatically in XNACK-enabled MI300A systems.
  Implicit Zero-copy behavior in `non unified_shared_memory` programs is triggered automatically in
  XNACK-enabled MI300A systems (for example, when using the `HSA_XNACK=1` environment
  variable). OpenMP supports the 'requires `unified_shared_memory`' directive to support programs
  that don’t want to copy data explicitly between the CPU and GPU. However, this requires that you add
  these directives to every translation unit of the program.

### **RCCL** (2.18.6)

#### Changed

* NCCL 2.18.6 compatibility.
  RCCL is now compatible with NCCL 2.18.6, which includes increasing the maximum IB network interfaces to 32 and fixing network device ordering when creating communicators with only one GPU
  per node.

* Doubled simultaneous communication channels.
  We improved MI300X performance by increasing the maximum number of simultaneous
  communication channels from 32 to 64.

### **rocALUTION** (3.1.1)

#### Added

* New multiple node and GPU support.
  Unsmoothed and smoothed aggregations and Ruge-Stueben AMG now work with multiple nodes
  and GPUs. For more information, refer to the 
  [API documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocALUTION/en/docs-6.1.0/usermanual/solvers.html#unsmoothed-aggregation-amg).

### **rocDecode** (0.5.0)

#### Added

* New ROCm component.
  rocDecode ROCm's newest component, providing high-performance video decode support for AMD
  GPUs. To learn more, refer to the 
  [documentation](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocDecode/en/latest/).

### **ROCm Data Center Tool** (0.3.0)

#### Changed

* C++ upgrades.
  RDC was upgraded from C++11 to C++17 to enable a more modern C++ standard when writing RDC plugins.

### **RPP** (1.5.0)

#### Added

* New backend support.
  Audio processing support added for the `HOST` backend and 3D Voxel kernels support
  for the `HOST` and `HIP` backends.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.0)

#### Added

* New datatype support.
  Added BF16 and FP8 datatypes based on General Matrix Multiply(GEMM) operations in the GPU Stress Test (GST) module. This provides additional performance benchmarking and stress testing based on the newly supported datatypes.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.25.0)

#### Added

* New EigenSolver routine.
  Based on the Jacobi algorithm, a new EigenSolver routine was added to the library. This routine computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix with improved performance.

### **ROCTracer** (4.1)

#### Changed

* New versioning and callback enhancements.
  Improved to match versioning changes in HIP Runtime and supports runtime API callbacks and activity record logging. The APIs of different runtimes at different levels are considered different API domains with assigned domain IDs.

## ROCm 6.0.2

See the [ROCm 6.0.2 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.0.2/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.13)

#### Changed

* Removed the Git submodule for shared files between rocFFT and hipFFT; instead, just copy the files
 over (this should help simplify downstream builds and packaging)

## ROCm 6.0.0

See the [ROCm 6.0.0 release notes](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/docs-6.0.0/about/release-notes.html)
for a complete overview of this release.

### **AMD SMI** (23.4.2)

#### Added

* Integrated the E-SMI (EPYC-SMI) library.
  You can now query CPU-related information directly through AMD SMI. Metrics include power,
  energy, performance, and other system details.

* Added support for gfx942 metrics.
  You can now query MI300 device metrics to get real-time information. Metrics include power,
  temperature, energy, and performance.

### **HIP** (6.0.0)

#### Added

* New features to improve resource interoperability.
  * For external resource interoperability, we've added new structs and enums.
  * We've added new members to HIP struct `hipDeviceProp_t` for surfaces, textures, and device
    identifiers.

#### Changed

* Changes impacting backward compatibility.
  There are several changes impacting backward compatibility: we changed some struct members and
  some enum values, and removed some deprecated flags. For additional information, please refer to
  the Changelog.

### **hipCUB** (3.0.0)

#### Changed

* Additional CUB API support.
  The hipCUB backend is updated to CUB and Thrust 2.1.

### **HIPIFY** (17.0.0)

#### Added

* Hipified rocSPARSE.
  We've implemented support for the direct hipification of additional cuSPARSE APIs into rocSPARSE
  APIs under the `--roc` option. This covers a major milestone in the roadmap towards complete
  cuSPARSE-to-rocSPARSE hipification.

#### Optimized

* Enhanced CUDA2HIP document generation.
  API versions are now listed in the CUDA2HIP documentation. To see if the application binary
  interface (ABI) has changed, refer to the
  [*C* column](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIPIFY/en/latest/tables/CUDA_Runtime_API_functions_supported_by_HIP.html)
  in our API documentation.

### **hipRAND** (2.10.16)

* Official release.
  hipRAND is now a *standalone project*--it's no longer available as a submodule for rocRAND.

### **hipTensor** (1.1.0)

#### Added

* Added architecture support.
  We've added contraction support for gfx942 architectures, and f32 and f64 data
  types.

#### Optimized

* Upgraded testing infrastructure.
  hipTensor will now support dynamic parameter configuration with input YAML config.

### **llvm-project** (17.0.0)

#### Added

* Added kernel argument optimization on gfx942.
  With the new feature, you can preload kernel arguments into Scalar General-Purpose Registers
  (SGPRs) rather than pass them in memory. This feature is enabled with a compiler option, which also
  controls the number of arguments to pass in SGPRs. For more information, see:
  [https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#preloaded-kernel-arguments](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#preloaded-kernel-arguments)

#### Optimized

* Improved register allocation at -O0.
  We've improved the register allocator used at -O0 to avoid compiler crashes (when the signature is
  'ran out of registers during register allocation').

* Improved generation of debug information.
  We've improved compile time when generating debug information for certain corner cases. We've
  also improved the compiler to eliminate compiler crashes when generating debug information.

### **MIGraphX** (2.8.0)

#### Added

* Added TorchMIGraphX.
  We introduced a Dynamo backend for Torch, which allows PyTorch to use MIGraphX directly
  without first requiring a model to be converted to the ONNX model format. With a single line of
  code, PyTorch users can utilize the performance and quantization benefits provided by MIGraphX.

* Added INT8 support across the MIGraphX portfolio.
  We now support the INT8 data type. MIGraphX can perform the quantization or ingest
  prequantized models. INT8 support extends to the MIGraphX execution provider for ONNX Runtime.

* Boosted overall performance with rocMLIR.
  We've integrated the rocMLIR library for ROCm-supported RDNA and CDNA GPUs. This
  technology provides MLIR-based convolution and GEMM kernel generation.

### **ROCgdb** (13.2)

#### Added

* Added support for additional GPU architectures.
  * Navi 3 series: gfx1100, gfx1101, and gfx1102.
  * MI300 series: gfx942.

### **ROCm SMI** (6.0.0)

#### Added

* Improved accessibility to GPU partition nodes.
  You can now view, set, and reset the compute and memory partitions. You'll also get notifications of
  a GPU busy state, which helps you avoid partition set or reset failure.

#### Optimized

* Upgraded GPU metrics version 1.4.
  The upgraded GPU metrics binary has an improved metric version format with a content version
  appended to it. You can read each metric within the binary without the full `rsmi_gpu_metric_t` data
  structure.

* Updated GPU index sorting.
  We made GPU index sorting consistent with other ROCm software tools by optimizing it to use
  `Bus:Device.Function` (BDF) instead of the card number.

### **ROCm Validation Suite** (1.0)

#### Added

* Added GPU and operating system support.
  We added support for MI300X GPU in GPU Stress Test (GST).

### **ROCProfiler** (2.0)

#### Added

* Added option to specify desired ROCProfiler version.
  You can now use rocProfV1 or rocProfV2 by specifying your desired version, as the legacy rocProf
  (`rocprofv1`) provides the option to use the latest version (`rocprofv2`).

* Added ATT support for parallel kernels.
  The automatic ISA dumping process also helps ATT successfully parse multiple kernels running in
  parallel, and provide cycle-accurate occupancy information for multiple kernels at the same time.

#### Changed

* Automated the ISA dumping process by Advance Thread Tracer.
  Advance Thread Tracer (ATT) no longer depends on user-supplied Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  and compilation process (using ``hipcc --save-temps``) to dump ISA from the running kernels.

### **ROCr Runtime** (1.12.0)

#### Added

* Support for SDMA link aggregation.
  If multiple XGMI links are available when making SDMA copies between GPUs, the copy is
  distributed over multiple links to increase peak bandwidth.

### **rocThrust** (3.0.0)

#### Added

* Added Thrust 2.1 API support.
  rocThrust backend is updated to Thrust and CUB 2.1.

### **rocWMMA** (1.3.0)

#### Added

* **Added new architecture support**.
    We added support for gfx942 architectures.

* **Added data type support**.
    We added support for f8, bf8, xf32 data types on supporting architectures, and for bf16 in the HIP RTC
    environment.

* **Added support for the PyTorch kernel plugin**.
    We added awareness of `__HIP_NO_HALF_CONVERSIONS__` to support PyTorch users.

### **TransferBench** (beta)

#### Optimized

* Improved ordering control.
  You can now set the thread block size (`BLOCK_SIZE`) and the thread block order (`BLOCK_ORDER`)
  in which thread blocks from different transfers are run when using a single stream.

* Added comprehensive reports.
  We modified individual transfers to report X Compute Clusters (XCC) ID when `SHOW_ITERATIONS`
  is set to 1.

* Improved accuracy in result validation.
  You can now validate results for each iteration instead of just once for all iterations.

### **ROCprofiler**

In ROCm 5.6 the `rocprofilerv1` and `rocprofilerv2` include and library files of
ROCm 5.5 are split into separate files. The `rocmtools` files that were
deprecated in ROCm 5.5 have been removed.

  | ROCm 5.6        | rocprofilerv1                       | rocprofilerv2                          |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
  | **Tool script** | `bin/rocprof`                       | `bin/rocprofv2`                        |
  | **API include** | `include/rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h` | `include/rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h` |
  | **API library** | `lib/librocprofiler.so.1`           | `lib/librocprofiler.so.2`              |

The ROCm Profiler Tool that uses `rocprofilerV1` can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprof …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV1` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV1 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.1`.

The ROCm Profiler that uses `rocprofilerV2` API can be invoked using the
following command:

```sh
$ rocprofv2 …
```

To write a custom tool based on the `rocprofilerV2` API do the following:

```C
main.c:
#include <rocprofiler/v2/rocprofiler.h> // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
int main() {
  // Use the rocprofilerV2 API
  return 0;
}
```

This can be built in the following manner:

```sh
$ gcc main.c -I/opt/rocm-5.6.0/include -L/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib -lrocprofiler64-v2
```

The resulting `a.out` will depend on
`/opt/rocm-5.6.0/lib/librocprofiler64.so.2`.

- CMake functionality to improve build parallelism of the test suite that splits compilation units by
function or by parameters.
- New overload for `BlockAdjacentDifference::SubtractLeftPartialTile` that takes a predecessor item.

#### Changed

- Improved build parallelism of the test suite by splitting up large compilation units for `DeviceRadixSort`, 
`DeviceSegmentedRadixSort` and `DeviceSegmentedSort`.
- CUB backend references CUB and thrust version 1.17.1.

### **hipFFT** (1.0.10)

### **hipSOLVER** (1.6.0)

#### Added

- Added compatibility-only functions
  - gesvdaStridedBatched
    - hipsolverDnSgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnDgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnCgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize, hipsolverDnZgesvdaStridedBatched_bufferSize
    - hipsolverDnSgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnDgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnCgesvdaStridedBatched, hipsolverDnZgesvdaStridedBatched

- client smoke test dataset added for quick validation using command rocblas-test --yaml rocblas_smoke.yaml
- Added stream order device memory allocation as a non-default beta option.

#### Changed

- Level 2, Level 1, and Extension functions: argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values.  With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer.   This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Add variable to turn on/off ieee16/ieee32 tests for mixed precision gemm
- Allow hipBLAS to select int8 datatype

- Created a rocfft_kernel_cache.db file next to the installed library. SBCC kernels are moved to this file when built with the library, and are runtime-compiled for new GPU architectures.
- Added gfx1100 and gfx1102 to default AMDGPU_TARGETS.

#### Changed

- Moved runtime compilation cache to in-memory by default.  A default on-disk cache can encounter contention problems 
on multi-node clusters with a shared filesystem.  rocFFT can still be told to use an on-disk cache by setting the 
ROCFFT_RTC_CACHE_PATH environment variable.

#### Optimized

- Optimized some strided large 1D plans.

### **rocPRIM** (2.12.0)

#### Changed

- `device_partition`, `device_unique`, and `device_reduce_by_key` now support problem 
  sizes larger than 2^32 items.

#### Removed

- `block_sort::sort()` overload for keys and values with a dynamic size. This overload was documented but the
  implementation is missing. To avoid further confusion the documentation is removed until a decision is made on
  implementing the function.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed the compilation failure in `device_merge` if the two key iterators don&#39;t match.

### **rocRAND** (2.10.16)

- LFSR113 pseudorandom number generator based on L&#39;Ecuyer, 1999, &#34;Tables of maximally equidistributed combined LFSR generators&#34;.
- SCRAMBLED_SOBOL32 and SCRAMBLED_SOBOL64 quasirandom number generators. The Scrambled Sobol sequences are generated by scrambling the output of a Sobol sequence.

#### Changed

- The `mrg_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution` structures, which provided numbers based on MRG32K3A, are now replaced by `mrg_engine_&lt;distribution&gt;_distribution`, where `&lt;distribution&gt;` is `log_normal`, `normal`, `poisson`, or `uniform`. These structures provide numbers for MRG31K3P (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg31k3p`) and MRG32K3A (with template type `rocrand_state_mrg32k3a`).

#### Resolved issues

- Sobol64 now returns 64 bits random numbers, instead of 32 bits random numbers. As a result, the performance of this generator has regressed.
- Fixed a bug that prevented compiling code in C++ mode (with a host compiler) when it included the rocRAND headers on Windows.

#### Optimized

- ParallelManager

### **rocBLAS** (2.45.0)

#### Added

- install.sh option --upgrade_tensile_venv_pip to upgrade Pip in Tensile Virtual Environment. The corresponding CMake option is TENSILE_VENV_UPGRADE_PIP.
- install.sh option --relocatable or -r adds rpath and removes ldconf entry on rocBLAS build.
- install.sh option --lazy-library-loading to enable on-demand loading of tensile library files at runtime to speedup rocBLAS initialization.
- Support for RHEL9 and CS9.
- Added Numerical checking routine for symmetric, Hermitian, and triangular matrices, so that they could be checked for any numerical abnormalities such as NaN, Zero, infinity and denormal value.

#### Changed

- Unifying library logic file names: affects HBH (-&gt;HHS_BH), BBH (-&gt;BBS_BH), 4xi8BH (-&gt;4xi8II_BH). All HPA types are using the new naming convention now.
- Level 3 function argument checking when the handle is set to rocblas_pointer_mode_host now returns the status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer only for pointers that must be dereferenced based on the alpha and beta argument values. With handle mode rocblas_pointer_mode_device only pointers that are always dereferenced regardless of alpha and beta values are checked and so may lead to a return status of rocblas_status_invalid_pointer. This improves consistency with legacy BLAS behaviour.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 function argument checking for enums is now more rigorously matching legacy BLAS so returns rocblas_status_invalid_value if arguments do not match the accepted subset.
- Add quick-return for internal trmm and gemm template functions.
- Moved function block sizes to a shared header file.
- Level 1, 2, and 3 functions use rocblas_stride datatype for offset.

- is_complex helper is now deprecated.  Use rocblas_is_complex instead.
- The enum truncate_t and the value truncate is now deprecated and will removed from the ROCm release 6.0. It is replaced by rocblas_truncate_t and rocblas_truncate, respectively. The new enum rocblas_truncate_t and the value rocblas_truncate could be used from this ROCm release for an easy transition.

- Optimized 1D 2^30 double precision on MI200.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed correctness of some R2C transforms with unusual strides.

### **rocPRIM** (2.10.13)

#### Added

- Future value
- Added device partition_three_way to partition input to three output iterators based on two predicates

#### Changed

- The reduce/scan algorithm precision issues in the tests has been resolved for half types.

#### Resolved issues

- Fixed radix sort int64_t bug introduced in [2.10.11]

#### Known issues

- device_segmented_radix_sort unit test failing for HIP on Windows

### **rocRAND** (2.10.13)

#### Added

- Generating a random sequence different sizes now produces the same sequence without gaps
  indepent of how many values are generated per call.
  - Only in the case of XORWOW, MRG32K3A, PHILOX4X32_10, SOBOL32 and SOBOL64
  - This only holds true if the size in each call is a divisor of the distributions
    `output_width` due to performance
  - Similarly the output pointer has to be aligned to `output_width * sizeof(output_type)`

#### Changed

- [hipRAND](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/hipRAND.git) split into a separate package
- Header file installation location changed to match other libraries.
  - Using the `rocrand.h` header file should now use `#include &lt;rocrand/rocrand.h&gt;`, rather than `#include &lt;rocrand/rocrand.h&gt;`
- rocRAND still includes hipRAND using a submodule
  - The rocRAND package also sets the provides field with hipRAND, so projects which require hipRAND can begin to specify it.

#### Resolved issues

- Fix offset behaviour for XORWOW, MRG32K3A and PHILOX4X32_10 generator, setting offset now
  correctly generates the same sequence starting from the offset.
  - Only uniform int and float will work as these can be generated with a single call to the generator

#### Known issues

- kernel_xorwow unit test is failing for certain GPU architectures.

### **rocSOLVER** (3.17.0)
